<p><span class="smcap">James Boswell</span> had not, by publishing his great
work, the Life of Dr. Samuel Johnson, completed his
literary plans. He preserved the letters he received
from notable persons, and retained copies of his own.
For many years he kept a journal, in which he recorded
not merely his conversations with Dr. Johnson, but the
diurnal occurrences of his own life. Respecting his
journal, in a letter to his friend Mr. Temple, dated 22nd
May, 1789, he writes:&mdash;“You have often told me that
I was the most thinking man you ever knew; it is certainly
so as to my own life. I am continually conscious,
continually looking back or looking forward, and wondering
how I shall feel in situations which I anticipate
in fancy. My journal will afford materials for a very
curious narrative. I assure you I do not now live with
a view to have surprising incidents, though I own I am
desirous that my life should tell.” Boswell evidently
intended to adapt the contents of his journal to an
autobiography; his early death precluded the intention.</p>

<p>Besides a journal, Boswell kept in a portfolio a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
quantity of loose quarto sheets, inscribed on each page
<span class="smcap">Boswelliana</span>. In certain of these sheets the pages
are denoted by numerals in the ordinary fashion; another
portion is numbered by the folios; while a
further portion consists of loose leaves and letterbacks.
The greater part of the entries are made so
carefully as to justify the belief that the author
intended to embody the whole in a volume of literary
anecdotes.</p>

<p>At Boswell’s death his portfolio was sold along with
the books contained in his house in London. It came
into the possession of John Hugh Smyth Pigott, Esq.,
of Brockley Hall, Somersetshire, an indefatigable book
collector. On Mr. Pigott’s death in 1861 the volume,
bound in russia, was sold along with the stores of the
Brockley library. Purchased by Mr. Thomas Kerslake,
bookseller in Bristol, it was afterwards sold by him to
Lord Houghton. By his lordship it was lately handed
to the Grampian Club, with a view to publication.</p>

<p>Boswell’s commonplace-book exhibits some of the
author’s weaknesses, but is on the whole a valuable
repertory. The social talk of leading persons during
the latter part of the century is graphically depicted.
Considerable light is thrown on the character of individuals
respecting whom every fragment of authentic
information is treasured with interest. In preparing
the commonplace-book for the press the Editor has
omitted a few entries which transgressed on decorum.
He has generally retained the author’s orthography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Memoir has been prepared with a desire to
depict the author’s history in his own words. Letters
to correspondents have been copiously introduced. Of
these a most interesting portion have been obtained
from the volume of Boswell’s Letters to Mr. Temple,
published by Mr. Bentley, under the care of Mr.
Francis. It is curious to remark that these letters,
like the commonplace-book, left the family of the owner,
and were accidentally discovered in the shop of a trader
at Boulogne.</p>

<p>The Editor cannot venture to enumerate all the kind
friends who have aided his inquiries. He has been
indebted to Lord Houghton for important particulars.
The representatives of Thomas David Boswell, the biographer’s
brother, and of his uncle, Dr. John Boswell,
have been most polite and obliging in their communications.
The Rev. W. H. Wylie has kindly furnished
Boswell’s address to the Ayrshire constituency.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS</h2>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">By Lord Houghton.</span></p>

<hr class="d2" />

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no word of vindication or appreciation to be
added to Mr. Carlyle’s estimate of the character and
merits of James Boswell. That judgment places him
so high that the most fantastic dream of his own self-importance
would have been fully realized, and yet
there is no disguise of his follies or condonation of his
vices. We understand at once the justice and the
injustice of his contemporaries, and while we are amused
at the thought of their astonishment could the future
fame of the object of so much banter and rude criticism
have been revealed to them, we doubt whether, had
we been in their place, our misapprehension and depreciation
would not have been still greater than theirs.</p>

<p>It was the object of Boswell’s life to connect his
own name with that of Dr. Johnson; the one is now
identified with the other. He aspired to transmit
to future time the more transitory and evanescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
forms of Johnson’s genius; he has become the repository
of all that is most significant and permanent.
The great “Dictionary” is superseded by wider and
more accurate linguistic knowledge; the succinct and
sententious biographies are replaced, where their subjects
are sufficiently important, by closer criticisms and by
antiquarian details, while in the majority of his subjects
the Lives and Works of the writers are alike forgotten.
The “Rambler” and the “Idler” stand among the
British Essayists, dust-worn and silent; and though a
well-informed Englishman would recognise a quotation
from “Rasselas” or “London,” he would hardly be expected
to remember the context.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the “Johnsoniad”
keeps fresh among us the noble image of the
moralist and the man, and when a philosopher of our
time says pleasantly of Boswell what Heinrich Heine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
said gravely of Goethe, that he measures the literary
faculty of his friends by the extent of their appreciation
of his idol, it is to a composite creation of the genius of
the master and of the sympathetic talent of the disciple
that is paid this singular homage. For it was assuredly
a certain analogy of character that fitted Boswell to be
the friendly devotee and intellectual servitor of Dr. Johnson,
and the resemblances of style and manner which are
visible even in the fragments brought together in this
volume cannot be regarded as parodies or conscious imitations,
but rather as illustrations of the mental harmony
which enabled the reporter to produce with such
signal fidelity, in the words of another, his own ideal of
all that was good and great.</p>

<p>“Elia,” with his charming othersidedness, writes, in
one place, “I love to lose myself in other men’s minds,”
and in another, “the habit of too constant intercourse
with spirits above you instead of raising you, keeps
you down; too frequent doses of original thinking from
others restrains what lesser portion of that faculty you
may possess in your own. You get entangled in another
man’s mind, even as you lose yourself in another man’s
ground; you are walking with a tall varlet, whose
strides outpace yours to lassitude.” Both observations
are true, and instances are not wanting of the spirit
of reverence and the habit of waiting on the words
and thoughts of those who are regarded as the spokesmen
of authority, emasculating the self-reliance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
thralling the free action of superior men. This is
especially observable in political life, where a certain
surrender of independence is indispensable to success,
but where, if carried too far, it tends to dwarf the
stature and plane down the beneficial varieties of public
characters. But there will always be many forces that
militate against this courtliness in the Republic of
Letters; leading men will have their clique, and too
often like to be kings of their company, but more
damage is done to themselves than to those who serve
them, and there is little fear of too rapid a succession of
Boswells or Eckermanns.</p>

<p>In these days of ready and abundant writing the
value of Conversation, as the oral tradition of social
intercourse, is not what it was in times when speech was
almost the exclusive communicator of intelligence between
man and man. Yet there will ever be an appreciation
of the peculiar talent which reproduces with
vivacity those fabrics of the hour, and gives to the
passing lights and shades of thought an artistic and
picturesque coherence. This is the product of a genial
spirit itself delighting in the verbal fray, and of a
society at once familiar and intellectual. We have
from other sources abundant details of the vivacity
of the upper classes of the Scottish community in the
latter half of the last century and the beginning of
the present. It had the gaiety which is the due relaxation
of stern and solid temperaments, and the
humour which is the genuine reverse of a deep sense
of realities and an inflexible logic. It was intemperate,
not with the intemperance of other northern
nations, to whom intoxication is either a diversion to
the torpor of the senses, or a narcotic applied by a
benevolent nature to an anxious and painful existence,
but with a conviviality which physical soundness and
moral determination enabled them to reconcile with
the sharpest attention to their material interests and
with the hardest professional work.</p>

<p class="pc small font1">IN THE POSSESSION OF LORD HOUGHTON.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<p>Scotland had had the remarkable destiny in its earlier
history of assimilating to itself the elements of a finer
civilisation without losing its independence or national
character; and it had even interchanged with the continent
of Europe various influences of manners and
speech. It had thus retained a certain intellectual self-sufficiency,
especially in its relations with English society
and literature, which never showed itself more distinctly
than in its estimate of Dr. Johnson and of his connection
with Boswell. In the pamphlets, and verses, and pictures
of the time, Boswell appears as a monomaniac, and Johnson
as an impostor. The oblong quarto of Caricatures
which followed their journey to the Hebrides shows that
Boswell not only did not gain any favour from his
countrymen, by introducing among them the writer,
who, however little understood in his entire worth,
nevertheless held a high place among English wits and
men of letters, but brought abundant ridicule on himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
his family, and his friend. It required all Boswell’s invincible
good humour to withstand the sarcasm that
assailed him. Dr. Johnson certainly repaid with interest
the prejudice and ill-will he encountered, but it
remains surprising that so good and intelligent a company
did not better recognise so great a man. We did not so
receive Burns and Walter Scott. The agreeable reminiscences
of Lord Cockburn and Dean Ramsay have
given us the evening lights of the long day of social
brightness which Scotland, and especially Edinburgh,
enjoyed; and if this pleasantness is now a thing of the
past, the citizens of the modern Athens have only shared
the lot of other sections of mankind, even of France,
<i>par excellence</i>, the country of Conversation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>This decadence in the art and practice of the communication
of ideas, and in the cultivation of facile and
coloured language, is commonly attributed to the wide
extension of literature and the press, which give to every
man all the knowledge of matters of interest which he
can require without the intervention of a fellow-creature.
It may be that men may now read and think too much
to talk, but the change is, perhaps, rather the effect of
certain alterations in the structure of society itself, accompanied
by the fastidiousness that tries to make up
by silence and seclusion for the arbitrary distinctions and
recognised barriers, which limited and defined the game
of life, but admitted so much pleasant freedom within
the rules. We can however, still acknowledge the value
of such records as those of the late Mr. Nassau, Senior,
whose “Conversations” with the most eminent politicians
and men of action of his time, especially in France,
afford trustworthy and interesting materials for the
future historian, and where a legal mind and well-trained
observation take the place of vivid representation and
literary skill. “Quand un bon mot,” writes Monsieur
L.’Enfant in one of his prefaces to his “Poggiana” “est<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
en même temps un trait d’Histoire, on fait aisèment
grace à’ce qui peut lui manquer du côté de la force et
du sel.”</p>

<p>The title of “Boswelliana,” which the editor has taken
from the original manuscript, is hardly correct. This is,
in fact, one of the note-books of the anecdotes and
<i>facetiæ</i> of the society in which Boswell lived; and
though such a use of the termination may find some
analogy in the Luculliana,&mdash;cherries that Lucullus
brought from Pontus&mdash;and the Appiana&mdash;apples introduced
into Rome by him of the Appian way,&mdash;yet the
term “Ana,” in its most important applications, has
always referred not to the collector, but to the personage
or at any rate to the subject-matter of the book. Some
vindication for its use on the present occasion may, however,
be found in those instances in which Boswell acts as
Bozzy to himself, and where the opinions and the mode of
enunciating them are so thoroughly Boswellian that they
give a characteristic flavour to the whole. What can be
more delightfully his own than the prefixes “Uxoriana,”
and “My son Alexander?”</p>

<p>There is some mystery in the insertion of certain
occasional Johnsoniana, which could hardly have found
their way into this collection, if Boswell had at the time
been keeping special memoranda of his great Oracle.
They are not very numerous nor consecutive, nor do
they imply that at the time they were taken down they
were intended as portions of the <i>magnum opus</i>. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
of them, however, are incorporated in it, and are only repeated
here to preserve the integrity of the manuscript.
The few omissions, such as they are, are of the same
character as the <i>lacunæ</i> in the Temple letters.</p>

<p>The historical and biographical annotation of these
anecdotes has been a work requiring considerable local
knowledge and antiquarian research. Executed, as it
is, by Dr. Rogers, it affords an interesting social picture
of the Scotland of the day, and there are many families
still living, who will here gladly recognise and welcome
the words and thoughts of their ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Dr. Johnson’s biographer, and the chronicler of his conversations,
James Boswell is entitled to remembrance. On the
publication of his “Life of Johnson,”&mdash;though seven years had
elapsed since the moralist’s decease, and two memoirs
had in the interval appeared,&mdash;a deep interest was excited;
and the author, whose peculiarities had hitherto subjected him
to ridicule, at once attained a first place as a biographer. Time,
which effects many changes in literary popularity, has borne
in an even current the “Life of Johnson,” and therewith in
every home of lettered Britons has rendered familiar the name
of Boswell.</p>

<p>Representing a landed branch of a Norman House, James
Boswell inherited no small share of family pride, a point
of character which under proper regulation might have
proved salutary. Sieur de Bosville accompanied William
of Normandy into England, and held a considerable command
at the battle of Hastings. His descendants migrated
into Scotland during the reign of David I., and there
acquired lands in the county of Berwick. Robert Bosville
obtained the lands of Oxmuir, in Berwickshire, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
William the Lion; he witnessed many charters in the
reign of that monarch. He was father of Adam de Bosville de
Oxmuir, whose name appears in an obligation of Philip de
Lochore in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II. In the lands
of Oxmuir he was succeeded by his son Roger, and his grandson
William de Bosville, the latter of whom was compelled with
other barons to swear fealty to Edward I. in 1296. Richard,
son of William, obtained from King Robert the Bruce, lands
near Ardrossan, in Ayrshire, in addition to his estates in
Berwickshire.</p>

<p>Roger de Boswell, second son of Richard of Oxmuir, married
in the reign of David II., Mariota, daughter and co-heiress of
Sir William Lochore of that ilk, with whom he obtained half
the barony of Auchterderran, in Fife. In this barony he was
succeeded by his son John de Boswell, who espoused Margaret,
daughter of Sir Robert Melville, of Carnbee. Their son, Sir
William Boswell, was judge in a perambulation of the lands of
Kirkness and Lochore. He married Elizabeth, daughter and
heiress of Alexander Gordon, with whom he got some lands in
the constabulary of Kinghorn. His son, Sir John Boswell,
designed of Balgregie, married, early in the fifteenth century,
Mariota, daughter of Sir John Glen, and with her obtained the
barony of Balmuto, in Fife.</p>

<p>Sir John Boswell, of Balmuto, was succeeded by his son
David, who married first Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John
Melville, of Raith, and secondly, Isabel, daughter of Sir Thomas
Wemyss, of Rires, relict of David Hay, of Naughton. Robert,
younger son by the first marriage, became parson of Auchterderran,
and was much esteemed for his piety and learning: he
attained his hundredth year. David, the elder son, obtained, in
1458, from James II., by a charter under the great seal, the lands
of Glasmont, in Fife. He married first Grizel, daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Sir John Wemyss of that ilk; and secondly, in 1430, Lady
Margaret Sinclair, daughter of William, Earl of Orkney and
Caithness. Thomas, eldest son of the second marriage, obtained
from James IV., as a signal mark of royal favour, the estate of
Auchinleck,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in Ayrshire. He was slain at Flodden on the 9th
September, 1513. By his wife Annabella, daughter of Sir Hugh
Campbell, of Loudoun, he had an only son David, who, succeeding
to the paternal estate, espoused Lady Janet Hamilton,
daughter of James, first Earl of Arran. David was succeeded
by his son John, whose first wife was Christian, daughter of Sir
Robert Dalzell, of Glenae, progenitor of the Earls of Carnwath.
Of this marriage, James, the eldest son, succeeded to Auchinleck.
He died in 1618, leaving by his wife, Marion Crawford, of
Kerse, six sons, three of whom entered the service of Gustavus
Adolphus, and ultimately settled in Sweden. David Boswell,
the eldest, succeeded to Auchinleck; he was an ardent supporter
of Charles I., and was fined ten thousand marks for refusing to
subscribe the Covenant. He married Isabel, daughter of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
John Wallace, of Cairnhill, but having no male issue, he was
at his death in 1661 succeeded by his nephew David, son of
his next brother James by his wife, a daughter of Sir James
Cunninghame, of Glengarnock.</p>

<p>David Boswell of Auchinleck espoused Anne, daughter of
James Hamilton of Dalziel, by whom, besides three daughters,
he had two sons, James and Robert. The latter settled in
Edinburgh as a Writer to the Signet, and acquiring a handsome
fortune, purchased from his kinsman, Andrew Boswell, the
estate of Balmuto, which had belonged to his ancestors. His
son, Claude James Boswell, born in 1742, passed advocate in
1766, and after serving eighteen years as sheriff of Fife, was in
1798 raised to the bench, under the judicial title of Lord
Balmuto.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His lordship died on the 22nd July, 1824.</p>

<p>James Boswell, elder son of David Boswell of Auchinleck,
succeeded to the paternal estate: he practised as an advocate,
and attained considerable eminence in his profession. By his
wife, Lady Elizabeth Bruce, daughter of Alexander, second
Earl of Kincardine, he had two sons and a daughter, Veronica;
she married David Montgomerie, of Lainshaw, and his daughter
Margaret espoused James Boswell, the subject of this memoir.
John, younger son of James Boswell of Auchinleck, studied
medicine, and became censor of the Royal College of Physicians,
Edinburgh. Alexander, the elder son, succeeded to Auchinleck
on his father’s death in 1748.</p>

<p>Through his father, Alexander Boswell was attracted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
legal studies; he passed advocate 29th December, 1729, and
after a period of successful practice at the bar, was in 1743
appointed sheriff of Wigtonshire. He was raised to the bench
in 1754, when he assumed the title of Lord Auchinleck;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
he was appointed a Lord of Justiciary in the following
year.</p>

<p>About the year 1739, Alexander Boswell married his
cousin<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Euphemia Erskine, descended of the ennobled House
of Erskine of Mar. Her father, Colonel John Erskine, was a
younger son of the Hon. Sir Charles Erskine, first baronet
of Alva, and her mother was Euphemia, one of the four
daughters of William Cochrane of Ochiltree, a scion of the noble
House of Dundonald by his wife Lady Mary Bruce, eldest
daughter of Alexander, second Earl of Kincardine. Of the marriage
of Alexander Boswell and Euphemia Erskine were born three
sons: John, the second son, became a military officer and died
unmarried; David, the youngest, entered a house of business,
and at the close of his apprenticeship in 1768 joined partnership
with Charles Herries, a Scotsman, and Honorius Dalliol, a
Frenchman, in establishing a mercantile house at Valencia in
Spain. On account of the Spaniards being prejudiced against
the name of David, as of Jewish origin, he assumed the
Christian name of Thomas. On account of the war he left
Spain in 1780, when he settled in London, and commenced
business as a merchant and banker. He afterwards accepted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
post in the Navy Office, where he became the head of the
Prize Department. He purchased the estate of Crawley Grange,
Buckinghamshire, and died in 1826. A man of grave deportment
and correct morals, he was esteemed for his discretion, urbanity,
and intelligence. By his marriage with Anne Catherine, sister
of General Sir Charles Green, Bart., he became father of one
child, Thomas David, who was born 24th September, 1800.
This gentleman succeeded his father in the estate of Crawley
Grange; he married in 1841 Jane, daughter of John Barker, Esq.
Having died without issue, his estate passed to another branch
of the Boswell family.</p>

<p>James Boswell, eldest son of Lord Auchinleck, was born at
Edinburgh on the 29th October, 1740. He received his rudimentary
training from a private tutor, Mr. John Dun, a native
of Eskdale, and who, on the presentation of his father, was, in
1752, ordained minister of Auchinleck. He was afterwards
sent to a school at Edinburgh, taught by Mr. James Mundell, a
teacher of eminence. Afterwards he was enrolled as a pupil in
the High School, under Mr. John Gilchrist, one of the masters,
a celebrated classical scholar.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Possessed of strong religious and political convictions, Lord
Auchinleck sought to imbue his children with a love of Presbyterianism
and a loyal attachment to the House of Hanover. In
those aims he was assisted by his wife, a woman of vigorous
sagacity and most exemplary piety. To her affectionate
counsel rather than to the wishes of his father, the eldest son
was disposed to yield some reverence. But he early affected to
despise the simple ritual of the Presbyterian Church, and in
direct antagonism to his father’s commands he declared himself
a Jacobite and a warm adherent of the exiled House. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
related to Dr. Johnson, that when his father prayed for King
George, he proceeded to pray for King James, till one day his
uncle, General Cochrane, gave him a shilling on condition that
he would pray for the Hanoverian monarch. The bribe overcame
his scruples, and he did as he was asked.</p>

<p>With a view to his becoming an advocate at the Scottish
Bar, Boswell entered the University of Edinburgh. There he
formed the acquaintance of Mr. William Johnson Temple, from
Allardine in Northumberland, a young gentleman preparing
in the literary classes for orders in the English Church. Mr.
Temple was Boswell’s senior, and much surpassed him in
general knowledge. He belonged to an old and respectable, if
not an affluent family, and he was of a pleasing and gentlemanly
deportment. The exiled king being forsaken, he became
Boswell’s next hero. In parting from him at the close of
their first college session, Boswell begged that their friendship
might be maintained by correspondence; and letters actually
passed between them for thirty-seven years. To Boswell’s share
of that correspondence we are indebted for many materials
illustrative of his life.</p>

<p>It will be convenient at this point to present a few particulars
of Mr. Temple’s career, closely associated as that gentleman was
with the subject of our history. After leaving Edinburgh he
sustained the loss of a considerable fortune through the embarrassments
of his father. Proceeding to the University of
Cambridge, he took the degree of LL.B., and soon afterwards
entered into orders. In 1767 he was preferred to the Rectory of
Mamhead, Devonshire, which, added to the Vicarage of St.
Gluvias, Cornwall, brought him, with the remains of his private
fortune, an income of £500 a year. In youth he afforded proof
of original power; he was a considerable politician, and an
excellent classical scholar. He composed neatly; his character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the poet Gray, with whom he was acquainted, has
been quoted approvingly by Dr. Mason, his biographer, and
likewise by Dr. Johnson. He published an essay on the
studies of the clergy, another “On the Abuse of Unrestrained
Power,” and “A Selection of Historical and Political Memoirs;”
but none of these compositions were much sought after.
He died on the 8th August, 1796, surviving our author
little more than a year. He was oppressed by an habitual
melancholy, which the untoward temper of his wife served
materially to intensify. He has been described as “Boswell’s
faithful monitor;” he was scarcely so, for his remonstrances
were feeble. Had he reproved sternly he might have been of
some service.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Temple dated 29th July, 1758, Boswell
informs him that he had been introduced to Mr. Hume, whom he
thus describes:&mdash;“He is a most discreet, affable man, as ever I
met with, and has really a great deal of learning, and a choice
collection of books. He is indeed an extraordinary man,&mdash;few
such people are to be met with now-a-days. We talk a great
deal of genius, fine language, improving our style, &amp;c., but I am
afraid solid learning is much wore out. Mr. Hume, I think,
is a very proper person for a young man to cultivate an
acquaintance with. Though he has not perhaps the most
delicate taste, yet he has applied himself with great attention
to the study of the ancients, and is likewise a great historian,
so that you are not only entertained in his company, but may
reap a great deal of useful instruction.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Temple proceeded to Cambridge he reported to his
Edinburgh friend that he was studying in earnest. In his
reply, dated 16th December, 1758, Boswell describes his own
studies:&mdash;“I can assure you,” he writes, “the study of the law
here is a most laborious task.... From nine to ten I attend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
law class; from ten to eleven study at home; and from one to
two attend a college [class] upon Roman antiquities; the afternoon
and evening I always spend in study. I never walk except
on Saturdays.” Thanking his friend for the perusal of a MS.
poem he adds, “To encourage you I have enclosed a few trifles of
my own.... I have published now and then the production
of a leisure hour in the magazines. If any of these essays can
give entertainment to my friend, I shall be extremely happy.”</p>

<p>On the importance of religion Boswell reciprocated his friend’s
sentiments. After informing him that the continuance of his
friendship made him “almost weep with joy,” he proceeds,
“May indulgent Heaven grant a continuance of our friendship!
As our minds improve in knowledge may the sacred flame
still increase, until at last we reach the glorious world above
when we shall never be separated, but enjoy an everlasting
society of bliss. Such thoughts as these employ my happy
moments, and make me&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">‘Feel a secret joy</p>
<p class="pp6">Spring o’er my heart, beyond the pride of kings.’”</p>

<p class="p1">After a reference to companionship he adds, “I hope by
Divine assistance, you shall still preserve your amiable character
amidst all the deceitful blandishments of vice and
folly.”</p>

<p>In the same letter Boswell informed Mr. Temple that he had
fallen desperately in love. The object of his affection was a
Miss W&mdash;&mdash; t, for so he disguises her name&mdash;a reticence in
matters of the heart which he does not evince subsequently.
After expatiating on the lady’s charms and angelic qualities,
especially her “just regard for true piety and religion,” he
remarks that “she <i>is</i> a fortune of thirty thousand pounds.”
With so large a dowry, he feels that she might be difficult
to win, but he conceives that “a youth of <i>his</i> turn has a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
chance to gain the affections of a lady of her character than of
any other.” He adds complacently, “As I told you before, my
mind is in such an agreeable situation, that being refused
would not be so fatal as to drive me to despair.” He sums up
by assuring his correspondent that he had entrusted the secret
of his passion only to another whose name was “Love.”</p>

<p>Mr. Love was one of Boswell’s early heroes. A native of
England, he was originally connected with Drury Lane Theatre,
but for some cause he left London and sojourned at Edinburgh.
There he at first practised private theatricals, but
afterwards became a teacher of elocution. He read with Miss
W&mdash;&mdash; t, and also with Boswell, though at different hours, and
advised the latter to look after the pretty heiress. Boswell
took the hint; but the dream soon passed away, for the name of
the rich beauty does not reappear.</p>

<p>To his young friend Mr. Love administered more useful
counsel by advising him to cultivate an easy style of composition.
To accomplish this he recommended him to keep a
journal or commonplace-book, and daily to record in it notes of
conversations, and of more remarkable occurrences. Boswell
acted on Mr. Love’s suggestion. Writing to Mr. Temple,
he reports that having gone with his father to the Northern
Circuit, he travelled in a chaise with Sir David Dalrymple
the whole way, and that he kept an exact journal at the
particular desire of his friend Mr. Love, and sent it to him
in sheets, by every post. Such was Boswell’s first effort in
journal-making; it was next to be practised on Paoli, and
latterly, with unprecedented success, on Dr. Johnson. As to
Mr. Love, it may be remarked that he compensated himself for
his early counsel by sponging his pupil. “Love is to breakfast
with me to-morrow,” wrote Boswell to Mr. Temple in July
1763. “I hope I shall get him to pay me up some more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
what he owes me. Pray, is <i>pay up</i> an English phrase, I know
<i>pay down</i> is?”</p>

<p>Sir David Dalrymple, Bart., better known by his judicial title
of Lord Hailes, was now an Advocate Depute,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> one of the faculty
specially retained by the Crown for arraigning offenders in the
Justiciary Court. An able lawyer, he had already afforded
evidence of his ability and accurate scholarship in several
separate publications and in various contributions to the
periodicals. Possessing a fund of information which he communicated
with much suavity of manner, Boswell hailed him
as his Mæcenas. Having enrolled him among his divinities,
he was disposed to idolize likewise all those whom he
approved. Of these the most conspicuous was Dr. Samuel
Johnson, whose existence was first made known to him
in a post-chaise conversation. He was delighted to learn
that he still lived, was the centre of a literary circle, had composed
a literary medley styled the <i>Rambler</i>, and had edited a
dictionary. As Sir David expatiated on his learning and his
virtues, Boswell resolved that one day Johnson should have a
place among his gods.</p>

<p>In November, 1759, Boswell entered the University of
Glasgow as a student of civil law; he also attended the
lectures of Dr. Adam Smith on moral philosophy and rhetoric.
His evenings were spent in places of public amusement. From
Mr. Love he had contracted a fancy for dramatic art, which in
the absence of a licensed theatre he could not gratify in the
capital. With more enlightened views the merchants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Glasgow tolerated theatrical representations, obtaining on their
boards such talent as their provincial situation could afford.
Among those who sought a livelihood at the Glasgow theatre was
Francis Gentleman, a native of Ireland, and originally an officer
in the army. This amiable gentleman sold his commission in
the hope of obtaining fame and opulence as a dramatic author;
but disappointed in obtaining a patron, he attempted to subsist
as an actor. He was entertained by Boswell, who encouraged
him to publish an edition of Southern’s tragedy of “Oroonoco,”
himself accepting the poetical dedication. The dedicatory verses
closed thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But, where, with honest pleasure, she can find<br />
Sense, taste, religion, and good nature joined,<br />
There gladly will she raise her feeble voice,<br />
Nor fear to tell that Boswell is her choice.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell’s patronage did not avail the unfortunate player. He
was compelled to leave Glasgow; thereafter he removed from
place to place, “experiencing all the hardships of a wandering
actor, and all the disappointments of a friendless author.” He
died in September, 1784.</p>

<p>At Glasgow, while spending his week-day evenings in places
of amusement, Boswell began to frequent on Sundays the services
of the Church of Rome. Before the end of the College
session he had resolved to embrace the Catholic faith, and to
qualify himself for orders in the Romish Church. These vagaries
were so distressing to his parents that he was recalled to Edinburgh.
He consented to abandon his sacerdotal aspirations,
provided he was allowed to substitute for the law the profession
of arms. In March 1760 his father accompanied him to London
in order to procure him a commission in the Guards. They
waited on the Duke of Argyll, who, according to Boswell’s narrative,
keenly discommended the military proposal. “My lord,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Duke, “I like your son; this boy must not be shot at for
three shillings and sixpence a day.” Lord Auchinleck soon
after returned to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Boswell was allowed to remain in London. His religious
views were opposed to his interests in the North, and it was
evident that he would not be restrained from avowing his belief
in public. It was therefore advisable that he should meanwhile
reside in London. At the request of his father, Lord Hailes
introduced him to Dr. Jortin, in the hope that that eminent
divine would lead him to conform to the doctrines of the
English Church. The following letter from Dr. Jortin to Lord
Hailes, dated 27th April, 1760, would imply that Boswell had
already, amidst the gaieties of London, ceased to concern himself
with ecclesiastical questions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your young gentleman<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> called at my house on Thursday
noon, April 3. I was gone out for the day, and he seemed to
be concerned at the disappointment, and proposed to come the
day following. My daughter told him that I should be engaged
at church, it being Good Friday. He then left your letter, and
a note with it for me, promising to be with me on Saturday
morning. But from that time to this I have heard nothing
of him. He began, I suppose, to suspect some design upon
him, and his new friends and fathers may have represented
me to him as an heretic and an infidel, whom he ought to avoid
as he would the plague. I should gladly have used my best
endeavours upon this melancholy occasion, but, to tell you the
truth, my hopes of success would have been small. Nothing is
more intractable than a fanatic. I heartily pity your good
friend. If his son be really sincere in his new superstition, and
sober in his morals, there is some comfort in that, for surely a
man may be a papist and an honest man. It is not to be expected
that the son should feel much for his father’s sorrows.
Religious bigotry eats up natural affection, and tears asunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the dearest bonds. Yet, if I had an opportunity I should have
touched that string, and tried whether there remained in his
breast any of the <i>veteris vestigia flammæ</i>.”</p>

<p class="p2">To his early attachment to the Romish Church, Boswell afterwards
refers only once. In a letter addressed to Mr. Temple
in November, 1789, he remarks that his “Popish imagination
induces him to regard his correspondent’s friendship as a kind
of <i>credit</i> on which he may in part repose.”</p>

<p>With his father Boswell was not candid in his professed
military ardour. In seeking a commission in the Guards, he
informed Mr. Temple<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> his desire was “to be about court,
enjoying the happiness of the <i>beau monde</i> and the company of
men of genius.” As to military zeal he afterwards announced
in a pamphlet,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that he was troubled with a natural timidity
of personal danger, which cost him some philosophy to overcome.</p>

<p>He protracted his residence in London for a whole year. For
some time he resided with Alexander, tenth Earl of Eglinton,
a warm friend of the Auchinleck family. By his lordship he
was introduced “into the circle of the great, the gay, and the
ingenious.” Having been presented to the Jockey Club, and
carried to Newmarket, he was deeply moved by the events of
the racecourse. Retiring to the coffee-room he composed a
poem, making himself the theme, though in styling himself
“The Cub at Newmarket” he gratified his egotism by the
forfeiture of dignity. Presented by Lord Eglinton to the Duke
of York, he invited his Royal Highness to listen to his poem,
and ventured to offer him the dedication. The Duke accepted
what it would have been ungracious to refuse, and Boswell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
printed his poem with an epistle dedicatory, in which he “let
the world know that this same Cub has been laughed at by
the Duke of York, had been read to his Royal Highness by the
genius himself, and warmed by the immediate beams of his
kind indulgence.” Boswell thus describes himself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Lord * * * * n, who has, you know,<br />
A little dash of whim or so;<br />
Who through a thousand scenes will range,<br />
To pick up anything that’s strange,<br />
By chance a curious cub had got,<br />
On Scotia’s mountains newly caught;<br />
And after driving him about<br />
Through London, many a diff’rent route,<br />
The comic episodes of which<br />
Would tire your lordship’s patience much;<br />
Newmarket Meeting being near,<br />
He thought ’twas best to have him there.<br />
<span class="ls1">*****</span><br />
He was not of the iron race<br />
Which sometimes Caledonia grace;<br />
Though he to combat could advance,<br />
Plumpness shone in his countenance;<br />
And belly prominent declared<br />
That he for beef and pudding cared;<br />
He had a large and pond’rous head,<br />
That seemed to be composed of lead;<br />
From which hung down such stiff, lank hair,<br />
As might the crows in autumn scare.”</p>

<p class="p1">For some time Lord Eglinton was amused by the juvenile
ardour and vivacity of his guest. At length, overcome by his
odd ways, he checked in plain terms his visitor’s vanity and
recklessness. The admonition was probably unheeded, for his
Lordship seems to have withdrawn his patronage. His own
career was cut short by a sad and memorable occurrence;
he was shot on his own estate by a poacher, whose firelock
he had forcibly seized. He died on the 25th October, 1769.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In London, Boswell got acquainted with the poet Derrick,
who became his companion and guide. Derrick was in his
thirty-sixth year. A native of Dublin, he had been apprenticed
to a linendraper, but speedily relinquished the concerns of trade.
In 1751 he proceeded to London and tried his fortune on the
stage. He next sought distinction as a poet. Introduced to
Dr. Johnson, he obtained a share of the lexicographer’s regard;
but, while entertaining affection for him as a man, the moralist
reproved his muse and condemned his levity. Writing to
Mr. Temple, Boswell refers to some of Derrick’s verses as “infamously
bad.” When Nash died, Derrick succeeded him as
master of ceremonies at Bath. He died there about the year
1770.</p>

<p>In April, 1761, Boswell, in reluctant obedience to his father’s
wishes, returned to Edinburgh. Writing to Mr. Temple on the
1st May, he implores his friend’s commiseration. “Consider this
poor fellow [meaning himself] hauled away to the town of Edinburgh,
obliged to conform to every Scotch custom, or be laughed
at&mdash;‘Will you hae some jeel? oh, fie! oh, fie!’&mdash;his flighty imagination
quite cramped, and he obliged to study ‘<i>Corpus Juris
Civilis</i>;’ and live in his father’s strict family; is there any wonder,
sir, that the unlucky dog should be somewhat fretful? Yoke a
Newmarket courser to a dung-cart, and I’ll lay my life on’t he’ll
either caper or kick most confoundedly, or be as stupid and
restive as an old battered post-horse.” In the same letter
Boswell acknowledges that his behaviour in London had been
the reverse of creditable. On his return to Edinburgh, he contributed
to a local periodical some notes on London life. This
narrative attracted the notice of John, thirteenth Lord Somerville,
a nobleman of singular urbanity and considerable literary
culture. His lordship invited the author to his table, commended
his composition, and urged him to perseverance. Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Somerville died in 1765. Boswell cherished his memory with
affection.</p>

<p>At Edinburgh, Boswell was admitted into the literary circles.
He dined familiarly with Lord Kames, was the disciple and
friend of Sir David Dalrymple, and passed long evenings with
Dr. Robertson and David Hume. His passion for the drama
gained force. At this period there was no licensed theatre in
Edinburgh, and among religious families playgoing was proscribed.
Just five years had elapsed since the Rev. John
Home, minister of Athelstaneford, had, on account of taking
part in the private representation of his tragedy of “Douglas,”
been constrained to resign his parochial charge. The popular
prejudice against theatricals was a sufficient cause for our
author falling into the opposite extreme; he threw his whole
energies into a movement which led six years afterwards to a
theatre being licensed in the capital.</p>

<p>Boswell’s chief associate in theatrical concerns was Mr. David
Ross, a tragedian who sometime practised on the London
boards, but who, like our author’s friends, Messrs. Love and
Gentleman, had been driven northward by misfortune. A native
of London, Mr. Ross was of Scottish parentage. His father had
practised in Edinburgh as a Writer to the Signet; he settled in
London in 1722 as a Solicitor of Appeals. Born in 1728,
David, his only son, was sent to Westminster School. There
he committed some indiscretion, which led to his expulsion and
his father’s implacable resentment. For some years he earned
subsistence as a commercial clerk, but obtaining from Quin
lessons in the dramatic art, he came on Covent Garden stage in
1753, where he acquired a second rank as a tragedian. Irregular
habits interfered with his advancement, and he proceeded to
Edinburgh, in the hope of obtaining professional support. He
became Master of Revels, and gave private entertainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which were appreciated and patronized. At length, on the 9th
December, 1767, he was privileged to open the first licensed
theatre in the capital. Boswell, at his request, composed the
‘prologue;’ the verses, now unhappily irrecoverable, were
described by Lord Mansfield as “witty and conciliating.” The
theatre proved a success, and the player soon afterwards
acquired by marriage considerable emolument. He accepted as
his wife Fanny Murray, who had in a less honourable connexion
been associated with a deceased nobleman, receiving with her
an annuity of two hundred pounds. Ross obtained a further
advance of fortune in a manner singularly unexpected. On
his death-bed his father made a will, excluding him from
any share of his property, and cruelly stipulating that his
sister “should pay him one shilling annually, on the first
day of May, his birthday, to remind him of his misfortune
in being born”! On the plea that by the law of Scotland, a
person could not bequeath an estate by mere words of exclusion
without an express conveyance of inheritance, Ross obtained
a reduction of the settlement, and on a decision by the House of
Lords got possession of six thousand pounds. He now retired
from the Edinburgh theatre, and renewed his engagements at
Covent Garden; but he soon became a victim to reckless
improvidence. To the close Boswell cherished his society,
though he did not venture to introduce him into literary circles.
He died in September, 1790. The following extract from
Boswell’s letter to Mr. Temple, dated 16th September, 1790,
will close the narrative of his career:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My old friend Ross, the player, died suddenly yesterday
morning. I was sent for, as his most particular friend in town,
and have been so busy in arranging his funeral, at which I am
to be chief mourner, that I have left myself very little time&mdash;only
about ten minutes. Poor Ross! he was an unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
man in some respects; but he was a true <i>bon vivant</i>, a most social
man, and never was without good eating and drinking, and
hearty companions. He had schoolfellows and friends who
stood by him wonderfully. I have discovered that Admiral
Barrington once sent him £100, and allowed him an annuity of
£60 a year.”</p>

<p class="p1">Among those of his own age and standing who supported
Boswell in managing theatricals at Edinburgh was the Honourable
Andrew Erskine, youngest son of Alexander, fifth Earl
of Kellie. This young gentleman, then a lieutenant in the
71st regiment, was abundantly facetious, and composed respectable
verses. Replying to a letter from Boswell, dated at
Auchinleck on the 25th August, Erskine expressed himself in
verse, and letters were exchanged on both sides for a considerable
period. Boswell meanwhile resolved to lay further claim
to the poet’s bays. In November he issued a poem in
sixteen Spenserian stanzas, covering a like number of printed
pages, entitled “An Ode to Tragedy, by a Gentleman of Scotland.”
It was characteristically inscribed to himself&mdash;the epistle
dedicatory proceeding thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The following ode which courts your acceptance is on a
subject grave and solemn, and therefore may be considered by
many people as not so well suited to your volatile disposition.
But I, sir, who enjoy the pleasure of your intimate acquaintance,
know that many of your hours of retirement are devoted
to thought, and that you can as strongly relish the productions
of a serious muse as the most brilliant sallies of sportive
fancy.”</p>

<p class="p1">Writing to Erskine on the 17th December, Boswell further
enlarges on his own personal qualities. “The author of ‘The
Ode to Tragedy,’” he proceeds, “is a most excellent man; he is of
an ancient family in the west of Scotland, upon which he values<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
himself not a little. At his nativity appeared omens of his future
greatness. His parts are bright, and his education has been good.
He has travelled in post-chaises miles without number. He eats of
every good dish, especially apple pie. He drinks old hock. He
has a very fine temper. He is somewhat of a humourist, and a
little tinctured with pride. He has a good manly countenance,
and owns himself to be amorous. He has infinite vivacity,
yet is observed at times to have a melancholy cast. He is
rather fat than lean, rather short than tall, rather young
than old. His shoes are neatly made, and he never wears
spectacles.”</p>

<p>In 1760, Mr. Erskine edited the first volume of a work in
duodecimo, entitled “A Collection of Original Poems, by the
Rev. Mr. Blacklock and other Scotch gentlemen.” This publication
contained compositions by Mr. Blacklock, Dr. Beattie, Mr.
Gordon of Dumfries, and others; it was published by Alexander
Donaldson,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> an Edinburgh bookseller, and was intended as
the first of a series of three volumes. The second volume was
considerably delayed, owing to Mr. Erskine’s absence with his
regiment, and on Boswell were latterly imposed the editorial
labours. As contributors Erskine and Boswell were associated
with Mr. Home, author of Douglas, Mr. Macpherson, editor of
Ossian, and others. Of twenty-eight pieces from Boswell’s pen
one is subjoined, eminently characteristic of its author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Writing to Erskine on the 8th December, 1761, Boswell remarks
that the second volume of the “Collection” was about to
appear, adding that his friend would “make a very good figure,
and himself a decent one.” But the public, while not disapproving
the strain of the known authors, condemned the levity
of the anonymous contributors, and thrust aside the book. The
publishing enterprise was ruined, and the projected third volume
did not appear.</p>

<p>Boswell determined to leave Edinburgh, assuring his father
that a military life was alone suited to his tastes. In a letter to
Erskine, dated the 4th of May, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My fondness for the Guards must appear very strange to
you, who have a rooted antipathy at the glare of scarlet. But
I must inform you that there is a city called London, for which
I have as violent an affection as the most romantic lover ever
had for his mistress. There a man may indeed soap his own
beard, and enjoy whatever is to be had in this transitory
state of things. Every agreeable whim may be fully indulged
without censure. I hope, however, you will not impute my
living in England to the same cause for which Hamlet was
advised to go there, because the people were all as mad as
himself.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Paternal remonstrances having proved unavailing, Boswell
was permitted to return to the metropolis. From Parliament
Place, Edinburgh, writing to Erskine on the 10th November,
he informs him that “on Monday next he is to set out for
London.” On the 20th November he writes from London, “If
I can get into the Guards, it will please me much; if not, I
can’t help it.”</p>

<p>Boswell brought from Scotland a recommendation to Charles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Duke of Queensberry, the patron of Gay, but that nobleman
took no part in his concerns. He again sought the field of
authorship. He and Erskine had corresponded on a variety of
topics, and he fancied that their letters might attract attention.
The letters were printed in an octavo volume,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Boswell
remarking in the preface, that he and his correspondent “have
made themselves laugh, and hope they will have the same effect
upon other people.” Erskine and Boswell were afterwards associated
in writing “Critical Strictures” on Mallet’s tragedy of
“Elvira,” acted at Drury Lane in the winter of 1762-3. In
1764, Erskine published a drama entitled “She’s not Him, and
He’s not Her; a Farce in Two Acts, as it is performed in the
Theatre in the Canongate.” In 1773 he issued “Town Eclogues,”
a poem of twenty-two quarto pages, intended “to expose the false
taste for florid description which prevails in modern poetry.”</p>

<p>From the 71st Erskine in 1763 exchanged into the 24th
Regiment, in which he became Captain. Retiring from the
army, he settled at Edinburgh. There he resided after 1790
with his sister, Lady Colville, at Drumsheugh, near the Dean
Bridge. He was an extraordinary pedestrian, and walked nearly
every morning to Queensferry, about ten miles distant, where
he breakfasted at Hall’s Inn. He dispensed with attendance,
and when he had finished his repast, left payment under a
plate. He was of a tall, portly form, and to the last wore
gaiters and a flapped vest. Though satirical with his pen, he
was genial and humorous in conversation. He was an early
admirer and occasional correspondent of the poet Burns. Like
his brother, “the musical Earl of Kellie,” he was a lover of
Scottish melodies, and was one of a party of amateurs who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
associated with Mr. George Thomson in designing his “Collection
of Scottish Airs.” He actively assisted Mr. Thomson in
the earlier stages of his undertaking. Several songs from his
pen, Burns, in a letter to Mr. Thomson, written in June, 1793,
described as “pretty,” adding, his “Love song is divine.” The
composition so described beginning “How sweet this lone
vale,” became widely popular; but the opening stanza only was
composed by him. He was one of the early friends of Archibald
Constable, the eminent publisher, who, in an autobiographical
fragment has described him as having “an excellent taste in the
fine arts,” and being “the most unassuming man he had ever
met.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> His habits were regular, but he indulged occasionally
at cards, and was partial to the game of whist. Having sustained
a serious loss at his favourite pastime he became frantic, and
threw himself into the Forth, and perished. This sad event
took place in September, 1793. In a letter to Mr. Thomson,
dated October, 1791, Burns writes that the tidings of Erskine’s
death had distressed and “scared” him.</p>

<p>From the day Sir David Dalrymple first named Dr. Samuel
Johnson in the post-chaise, Boswell entertained a hope of
forming the lexicographer’s acquaintance. On his former visit
to London he had exerted some effort to procure an introduction.
Derrick promised it, but lacked opportunity. During the
summer of 1761, Thomas Sheridan lectured at Edinburgh on the
practice of elocution, and charmed Boswell by descanting on
Dr. Johnson’s virtues. Through Sheridan an introduction
seemed easy, but Boswell on visiting him found that he and
the lexicographer had differed. Boswell did not despair. He
obtained leave to occupy his friend Mr. Temple’s chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the Inner Temple, near Dr. Johnson’s residence, and adjoining
his well-known haunts.</p>

<p>A further effort was necessary. Boswell ingratiated himself
with Mr. Thomas Davies, bookseller, of No. 8, Russell Street,
Covent Garden, formerly a player. Mr. Davies knew Dr.
Johnson well, saw him frequently in his shop, and was privileged
to entertain him at his table. To meet Boswell, the lexicographer
was invited more than once, but as our author puts it, “he was
by some unlucky accident or other prevented from coming to
us.” In an unexpected manner Boswell at length attained his
wishes. The occurrence must be described in his own words:&mdash;“At
last, on Monday, the 16th of May, when I was sitting in
Mr. Davies’ back parlour, after having drunk tea with him and
Mrs. Davies,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Johnson unexpectedly came into the shop; and
Mr. Davies having perceived him through the glass door in the
room in which we were sitting advancing towards us, he
announced his awful approach to me something in the manner
of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet
on the appearance of his father’s ghost,&mdash;‘Look, my lord, it
comes!’ * * * Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and respectfully
introduced me to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting
his prejudice against the Scotch, of which I had
heard much, I said to Davies, ‘Don’t tell where I come from.’
‘From Scotland,’ cried Davies, roguishly. ‘Mr. Johnson,’ said
I, ‘I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.’ I
am willing to flatter myself that I meant this as light pleasantry
to soothe and conciliate him, and not as a humiliating abasement
at the expense of my country. But however that might
be, this speech was somewhat unlucky; for with that quickness
of wit for which he was so remarkable he seized the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“come from Scotland,” which I used in the sense of being of
that country; and as if I had said I had come away from it or
left it, retorted, ‘That, sir, I find, is what a very great many of
your countrymen cannot help.’ This stroke stunned me a good
deal; and when we had sat down I felt myself not a little
embarrassed, and apprehensive of what might come next.
He then addressed himself to Davies: ‘What do you think of
Garrick? He has refused me an order for the play for Miss
Williams, because he knows the house will be full, and that an
order would be worth three shillings.’ Eager to take any
opening to get into conversation with him, I ventured to say,
‘Oh, sir, I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle
to you.’ ‘Sir,’ said he, with a stern look, ‘I have known
David Garrick longer than you have done, and I know no right
you have to talk to me on this subject.’ Perhaps I deserved
this check; for it was rather presumptuous in me, an entire
stranger, to express any doubt of the justice of his animadversion
upon his old acquaintance and pupil. I now felt myself
much mortified, and began to think that the hope which I had
long indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted. And
in truth, had not my ardour been uncommonly strong, and my
resolution uncommonly persevering, so rough a reception might
have deterred me for ever from making any further attempts.
Fortunately, however, I remained upon the field not wholly
discomfited, and was soon rewarded by hearing some of his
conversation.” Boswell closes his narrative thus:&mdash;“I had
for a part of the evening been left alone with him, and
had ventured to make an observation now and then, which he
received very civilly, so that I was satisfied that though there
was a roughness in his manner, there was no ill-nature in his
disposition. Davies followed me to the door, and when I
complained to him a little of the hard blows which the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
man had given me, he kindly took upon him to console me
by saying, ‘Don’t be uneasy. I can see he likes you very well.’”</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson regarded Boswell as an adventurer, who had come
to London in quest of literary employment. Davies perceiving
this, privately explained to him that Boswell was the son of a
Scottish judge and heir to a good estate. “A few days afterwards,”
writes Boswell, “I called on Davies, and asked him if he thought
I might take the liberty of waiting on Mr. Johnson at his
chambers in the Temple. He said I certainly might, and that
<i>Mr. Johnson would take it as a compliment</i>. So upon Tuesday,
the 24th of May, after having been enlivened by the witty sallies
of Messieurs Thornton, Wilkes, Churchill, and Lloyd, with whom
I had passed the morning, I boldly repaired to Johnson. His
chambers were on the first floor of No. 1, Inner Temple Lane,
and I entered them with an impression given me by the Rev.
Dr. Blair, of Edinburgh, who had been introduced to me not
long before and described his having ‘found the giant in his
den,’ an expression which, when I came to be pretty well
acquainted with Johnson, I repeated to him, and he was diverted
at this picturesque account of himself. * * * He received
me very courteously; but it must be confessed that his apartment
and furniture and morning dress were sufficiently
uncouth. His brown suit of clothes looked very rusty; he had
on a little old shrivelled unpowdered wig, which was too small
for his head; his shirt-neck and knees of his breeches were
loose; his black worsted stockings ill drawn up, and he had a
pair of unbuckled shoes by way of slippers. But all these
slovenly particularities were forgotten the moment that he
began to talk. Some gentlemen, whom I do not recollect, were
sitting with him; and when they went away I also rose, but
he said to me, ‘Nay, don’t go.’ ‘Sir,’ said I, ‘I am afraid that
I intrude upon you. It is benevolent to allow me to sit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
hear you.’ He seemed pleased with this compliment, which I
sincerely paid him, and answered, ‘Sir, I am obliged to any
man who visits me.’ * * * Before we parted he was so
good as to promise to favour me with his company one evening
at my lodgings; and as I took my leave, shook me cordially by
the hand. It is almost needless to add that I felt no little
elation at having now so happily established an acquaintance of
which I had been so long ambitious.”</p>

<p>The evident sincerity of Boswell’s respect pleased and flattered
Dr. Johnson. He listened to details of literary life in Edinburgh,
and was gratified to learn that certain Scotsmen appreciated his
learning. He visited Boswell in his chambers, and invited him
to the Mitre Tavern, where afterwards they frequently supped,
and drank port till long after midnight. At one of these festive
meetings Boswell related the story of the post-chaise, and expatiated
on the merits of Sir David Dalrymple with the ardour of
a hero worshipper. Dr. Johnson toasted Sir David in a bumper
as “a man of worth, a scholar, and a wit.” He added, “I have,
however, never heard of him except from you; but let him
know my opinion of him, for as he does not show himself much
in the world, he should know the praise of the few who hear
of him.” On the 2nd of July, Boswell communicated with
Sir David Dalrymple in these terms:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am now upon a very good footing with Mr. Johnson. His
conversation is instructive and entertaining. He has a most
extensive fund of knowledge, a very clear expression, and much
strong humour. I am often with him. Some nights ago we
supped by ourselves at the Mitre Tavern, and sat over a sober
bottle till between one and two in the morning. We talked a
good deal of you. We drank your health, and he desired me to
tell you so. When I am in his company I am rationally happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
I am attentive and eager to learn, and I would hope that I may
receive advantage from such society.”</p>

<p class="p1">To Boswell’s letter, in its allusion to Dr. Johnson, Sir David
Dalrymple made the following answer:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It gives me pleasure to think that you have obtained the
friendship of Mr. Samuel Johnson. He is one of the best moral
writers which England has produced. At the same time I envy
you the free and undisguised converse with such a man. May
I beg you to present my best respects to him, and to assure him
of the veneration which I entertain for the author of the
‘Rambler’ and of ‘Rasselas.’”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 15th July Boswell thus communicated with Mr.
Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I had the honour of supping <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Mr. Johnson
last night; by-the-bye, I need not have used a French phrase.
We sat till between two and three. He took me by the hand
cordially, and said, ‘My dear Boswell, I love you very much.’
Now, Temple, can I help indulging vanity?”</p>

<p class="p1">After quoting a portion of Sir David Dalrymple’s letter, he
proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Mr. Johnson was in vast good humour, and we had much
conversation. I mentioned Fresnoy to him, but he advised me
not to follow a plan, and he declared that he himself never
followed one above two days. He advised me to read just as
inclination prompted me, which alone, he said, would do me any
good; for I had better go into company than read a set task.
Let us study ever so much, we must still be ignorant of a good
deal. Therefore the question is, what parts of science do we
want to know? He said, too, that idleness was a distemper
which I ought to combat against, and that I should prescribe to
myself five hours a day, and in these hours gratify whatever
literary desires may spring up. He is to give me his advice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to what books I should take with me from England. I told him
that the <i>Rambler</i> shall accompany me round Europe, and so be
a Rambler indeed. He gave me a smile of complacency.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Dr. Johnson on the 14th of July, so
described to Mr. Temple, also forms the subject of a letter to
Sir David Dalrymple. That letter proceeds thus:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Wednesday evening, Mr. Johnson and I had another
<i>tête-à-tête</i> at the ‘Mitre.’ Would you believe that we sat from
half an hour after eight till between two and three! He took
me cordially by the hand and said, ‘My dear Boswell! I love
you very much.’ Can I help being somewhat vain? * * *
He advises me to combat idleness as a distemper, to read five
hours every day, but to let inclination direct me what to read.
He is a great enemy to a stated plan of study. He advises me
when abroad to go to places where there is most to be seen and
learnt. He is not very fond of the notion of spending a whole
winter in a Dutch town. He thinks I may do much more by
private study than by attending lectures. He would have me
to perambulate (a word in his own style) Spain. He says a
man might see a good deal by visiting their inland towns and
universities. He also advises me to visit the northern kingdoms,
where more that is new is to be seen than in France and Italy,
but he is not against my seeing these warmer regions.”</p>

<p class="p1">These allusions to foreign travel refer to a proposal by Lord
Auchinleck that his son should study civil law at Utrecht, and
in which Boswell was disposed to acquiesce, believing that in
thus gratifying his father’s wishes he might be permitted before
returning home to visit the principal countries of the Continent.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 21st July, Johnson supped at Boswell’s
chambers, when were also present Mr. George Dempster, M.P.,
and the host’s paternal uncle, Dr. John Boswell, from Edinburgh.
The occasion was one of the most memorable in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Boswell’s intercourse with his illustrious associate. Dr. Boswell
entertained loose notions of religion, and Mr. Dempster was
a disciple of David Hume. Dempster made a violent attack
on Christianity, repeating the arguments of Rousseau, and
quoting approvingly the sentiments of Hume and Gibbon. Dr.
Boswell preserved a general silence, but was disposed to smile
approvingly at Dempster’s sallies. In the society of his new
acquaintance, Dr. Johnson was appalled to find a bold
upholder of infidel sentiments, and his indignation was proportionate.
He assailed Dempster with much severity, exposing
the sophistry of his school. Boswell took notes of the conversation,
doubtless intending to utilize what he had written. Next
morning he hastened to Dr. Johnson’s chambers to express disapproval
of Dempster’s sentiments. Dr. Johnson answered,
“I have not met with any man for a long time who has given
me such general displeasure. He is totally unfixed in his
principles, and wants to puzzle other people.” This utterance
is presented by Boswell in Dr. Johnson’s memoirs with the
prefatory remark, “Of a gentleman who was mentioned he said,”
&amp;c. Boswell became very intimate with Mr. Dempster, and so
erased from his journal all memorials of the evening’s conversation.
Not very creditably he affirms, in Johnson’s Life, that
the evening was wholly occupied “in the discussion of social
and political questions.” But the truth, which Boswell sought
to suppress, reaches us in his own words from two different
channels. To Mr. Temple, on the 23rd of July, he wrote
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Wednesday evening, Mr. Johnson, Dempster, and my
uncle Dr. Boswell, supped with me at my chambers. I had
prodigious satisfaction to find Dempster’s sophistry (which he
has learned from Hume and Rousseau) vanquished by the solid
sense and vigorous reasoning of Johnson. It was a very fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
evening, and <i>my journal is stored with its fruits</i>. Dempster
was as happy as a vanquished argumentator could he; and
the honest Doctor was cheerful and conversible and highly
entertained.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the same day Boswell communicated with Sir David
Dalrymple in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Mr. Johnson did me the honour to sup with me at my
chambers some nights ago. <i>Entre nous</i>, he said that Dempster,
who was also with me, gave him more general displeasure than
any man he has met with of a long time. He saw a pupil of
Hume and of Rousseau totally unsettled as to principles, and
endeavouring to puzzle and shake other people with childish
sophistry. I had infinite satisfaction in hearing solid truth
confuting vain subtilty. * * * I thank God that I have
got acquainted with Mr. Johnson. He has done me infinite
service. He has assisted me to obtain peace of mind; he has
assisted me to become a rational Christian; I hope I shall ever
remain so.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p class="p1">In referring to his having become a rational Christian, Boswell
desired to satisfy his Scottish Mæcenas that he had personally
abandoned the superstitions of Romish worship. Mr. Dempster’s
religious views, together with his personal history and his
acquaintance with Boswell, may be finally disposed of. Grandson
of George Dempster, merchant and banker at Dundee, he
succeeded to several important estates, which his ancestor had
acquired by granting extensive loans on mortgages to the
former proprietors. Born in 1735, he studied at the University
of Edinburgh, and in that city formed the intimacy of Dr.
William Robertson, Alexander Carlyle, John Home, and other
eminent clergymen. Under their auspices he sat as a lay member
in the General Assembly; and in that court he opposed his
friends by seconding the injunction of the House passed in 1757,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
forbidding the clergy to countenance theatricals.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Becoming
acquainted with David Hume, he renounced Presbyterianism,
and embraced infidelity. He abandoned the Scottish Bar to
which he had been called, and became candidate for the parliamentary
representation of the Fife and Forfar burghs. By a
narrow majority he secured his seat, but he was convicted of
bribery and the election was annulled. To accomplish his end
he had sold two fine estates, and expended nearly £15,000. On
presenting himself to the constituents the second time he was
returned under less exceptionable circumstances. He retained
his seat from 1762 till 1790. He would join no political party,
probably owing to an uncertainty of judgment, which was partly
an inheritance; two of his ancestors being deposed and afterwards
restored to the ministry for certain changes in their civil
and ecclesiastical opinions. According to Boswell he early
cherished republican sentiments; latterly he resisted the revolutionary
ferment created by the French Directory. By the
general public he was esteemed a patriot, and was provincially
known as “Honest George.” The poet Burns held that he
should have been ennobled. He supported some liberal
measures, and certain important services are associated with his
name. He denounced the conflict with the American colonies,
opposed the sovereignty exercised by the East India Company,
sought to remove all restraints from the national commerce, and
advocated the abolition of sinecures. On retiring from Parliament,
he devoted himself to the promotion of agriculture and
manufactures in North Britain. He established an agricultural
society on his estate.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He improved the condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Scottish fisheries, and discovered a method of preserving
salmon for the London market. He was much respected on his
estate, was benevolent to the poor, and exercised a generous
hospitality. He did not attend church on the plea of feeble
health, but he associated with the clergy of his neighbourhood,
and to his household spoke reverently of religion. In some
twenty of his letters, written at intervals during a period of
twenty-five years preceding his decease, the writer has on a
close examination been unable to detect any remark savouring
of scepticism. Yet it is nearly certain that he cherished to the
close of a long life the blighting infidelity of David Hume.
To the Right Hon. John Wilson Croker was communicated by
Sir Walter Scott the following metrical epitaph, which it was
alleged Mr. Dempster composed upon himself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Pray for the soul of deceased George Dempster,<br />
In his youth a great fool, in his old age a gamester;<br />
What you’re to know, on this tomb you shall see,<br />
Life’s thread he let go when just ninety-three.<br />
So sound was his bottom, his acquaintance all wonder’d<br />
How old Nick had got him till he lived out the hundred.<br />
To his money concerns he paid little attention,<br />
First selling his land, then pawning his pension;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><br />
But his precious time he much better did manage,<br />
To the end of his life from his earliest nonage,<br />
He divided his hours into two equal parts,<br />
And spent one half in sleeping, the other at <i>cartes</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Dempster died on his estate of Dunnichen, Forfarshire,
on the 13th February, 1818, at the age of eighty-four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In May, 1763, two months before the period reached in the
preceding narrative, Boswell asked Sir David Dalrymple to
interpose with his father, who was threatening to disinherit him
on account of his unsettled habits. He concludes a letter to
Sir David in these words,&mdash;“Tell him to have patience
with me for a year or two, and I may be what he pleases.” In
June he informs Sir David that his father’s proposal that he
should proceed to Utrecht, there to study civil law under the
celebrated M. Trotz had met with his acceptance, and that his
father was “much pleased to find in him so prudent a
disposition.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>He adds,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My great object is to attain a proper conduct in life. How
sad will it be if I turn no better than I am! I have much
vivacity, which leads me to dissipation and folly. This I think
I can restrain. But I will be moderate, and not aim at a stiff
sageness and buckram correctness. I must, however, own to
you that I have at bottom a melancholy cast, which dissipation
relieves by making me thoughtless, and therefore an easier
though a more contemptible animal. I dread a return of this
malady. I am always apprehensive of it.”</p>

<p class="p1">About the Utrecht scheme he writes to Mr. Temple on the
15th July, “I have had a long letter from my father, full of
affection and good counsel. Honest man, he is now very
happy: it is amazing to think how much he has had at heart
my pursuing the road of civil life; he is anxious for fear I
should fall off from my prudent system, and return to my
dissipated, unsettled way of thinking; and in order to make
him easy, he insists on having my solemn promise that I will
persist in the scheme on which he is so earnestly bent: he
knows my fidelity, and he concludes that my promise will fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
me. Indeed he is much in the right; the only question is, how
much I am to promise. I think I may promise this much,&mdash;that
I shall from this time study propriety of conduct, and to
be a man of knowledge and prudence, as far as I can; that I
shall make as much improvement as possible while I am abroad,
and when I return shall put on the gown as a member of the
Faculty of Advocates, and be upon the footing of a gentleman
of business, with a view to my getting into Parliament.”</p>

<p>For the use of Mr. Temple’s chambers Boswell paid his
proportion of rent, but his occupancy was burdened with the
condition that his friend’s brother, a youth of seventeen, might
as occasion suited share the accommodation. This young
gentleman, Mr. Robert Temple, held a commission in the line,
but was not very ardent in his military duties. Boswell’s early
intercourse with him was abundantly characteristic. To his
brother he reported of him on the 15th July, that “his genius
and application consisted in washing his face and brushing
his hat, which he will execute in a few hours;” adding, “I find
it somewhat inconvenient to have anybody in chambers with
me.... I have allowed him to be too free with me; and I own
it hurts me when I find my folly bringing me into the situation
of being upon an equality with if not below the young man.”
On the 23rd of July he in these doggerel verses celebrated the
youth on his returning from a visit to Salisbury:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Bob Temple has at Sarum been,<br />
And all the pretty girls has seen;<br />
But he came back in the machine</p>
<p class="pp7">Because he was the barber!</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“From Mother Bowles he got good wine;<br />
He licked his lips and called it fine;<br />
But now the dog at Cliff’s must dine,</p>
<p class="pp7">And is not that the barber?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In a few days afterwards, Master Robert having begun to
borrow one guinea after another, is described as “selfish,” of
a “heedless disposition,” and having “no great powers either
of understanding or imagination.” Boswell sums up; “I am
glad he goes down to Cambridge.”</p>

<p>In his letter to Sir David Dalrymple of the 23rd July, Boswell
enters into some details respecting the Utrecht scheme,
and expresses a determination thoroughly to acquaint himself
with the law of nations. He has resolved to transcribe the
whole of Erskine’s Institutes,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that the details might be impressed
in his memory.</p>

<p>The progress of the Utrecht arrangement is reported in the
following letter to Mr. Temple, dated 20th July:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have this night received a large packet from my father,
with my letter of credit, and several letters of recommendation
to different people in Holland. The letters have been sent open
for me to seal, so I have been amused to see the different modes
of treating that favourite subject myself. Sir David Dalrymple
has written to Count Nassau; his letter is in French and is
exceedingly genteel. He recommends Mr. Boswell as <i>un jeune
homme de famille et de mérite</i>, and hopes he will find in the
Count <i>le guide et le protecteur de sa jeunesse</i>. My father writes
to Mynheer Abrahamus Gronovius, an old <i>literatus</i> at Leyden.
It is an excellent letter, and recalls their old ideas with more
liveliness than you would imagine. I have several other letters,
so that I can be at no loss where I am going, especially as I
have got some relations of the first fashion at the Hague. My
father has allowed me £60 a quarter&mdash;£240 a year; that is not
a great allowance, but with economy I may live very well upon
it, for Holland is a cheap country. However, I am determined
not to be straitened, nor to encourage the least narrowness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
disposition as to saving money, but will draw upon my father
for any sums I find necessary. My affairs being thus far settled,
I must set out soon. I can have no excuse for indulging myself
in a much longer stay in London; and yet I must own to
you, my dear friend, that I feel a good deal of uneasiness at the
thoughts of quitting the place where my affection is truly
centred, for there I enjoy most happiness; however, I am determined
to go next week. I hope I shall not be feeble-minded,
but pluck up manly resolution, and consider that I am leaving
London in order to see the world, store my mind with more
ideas, establish a proper character, and then return to the metropolis
much happier, and more qualified for a solid relish of its
advantages.”</p>

<p class="p1">After the lapse of three days Boswell wrote to Mr. Temple
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4 p1">“<i>Inner Temple,</i></p>
<p class="pr2"><i>28th July, 1763.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Temple</span>,</p>

<p class="pi4a">I have now fixed to-morrow se’nnight, Friday, the 5th of
August, for the day of my departure; and on Saturday, the 6th,
I shall be upon the Channel. Alas, my friend! let me disclose
my weakness to you. My departure fills me with a kind of
gloom that quite overshadows my mind. I could almost weep
to think of leaving dear London and the calm retirement of the
Inner Temple. I am now launching into the wide world, and
am to be long at a distance from my dear Temple, whose kind
and amiable counsel never failed to soothe my dejected mind.
You may see I am somewhat melancholy; pray comfort me.
This is very effeminate and very young, but I cannot help it.
My time is fixed, and I will go; I have taken my resolution, and
you shall see that I can keep to it. I enclose you a friendly dissertation,
which you may read at your leisure; it will show
how much stronger my mind was last night only. I am just
going to meet Mr. Johnson at the ‘Turk’s Head.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The meeting with Johnson in the “Turk’s Head” coffee-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is duly chronicled in the “Life.” Boswell expressed himself
as resolved on proceeding to Utrecht, and asked for advice.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Johnson, “let us make a day of it; let us go
down to Greenwich and dine, and talk of it fully, so that I shall
say,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘On Thames’s bank in silent thought we stood,<br />
Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood.’”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The friends proceeded to Greenwich on Saturday, the 30th.
They inspected the hospital, walked in the park, and returning
to London by the river, closed the day’s excursion by supping
together at the “Turk’s Head.” During the evening Boswell
entertained his Mentor by expatiating on the history of his
House, and the extent and importance of the family estate. By
Johnson no allusion was made to the ostensible purpose of the
meeting; it was enough that on a day of the week when Boswell
was likely to meet with bad counsellors, he and his purse
were protected from their embrace. The friends met on Sunday.
On Tuesday they were both morning and evening together. On
Wednesday evening they supped at the “Turk’s Head,” when
Johnson renewed his promise to start with his friend for
Harwich early on Friday morning.</p>

<p>As Boswell was for a considerable period to be left to his
own control, Sir David Dalrymple sent him a letter of advice,
along with some commissions to be executed in course of his
tour. To Sir David’s letter Boswell on the 2nd August made
the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My scepticism was not owing to thinking wrong, but to not
thinking at all. It is a matter of great moment to keep a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of religion constantly impressed upon our minds. If that divine
guest does not occupy part of the space, vain intruders will;
and when once they have got in it is difficult to get them out
again. I shall remember your commission about the Greek
Lyrics. I shall hear what the librarian says, and I shall
make diligent search myself. As to the MSS. of Anacreon,
Mr. Johnson says he doubts much if there be such a thing at
Leyden.”</p>

<p class="p1">Of no settled convictions, Boswell was, under his protestations
of orthodoxy, considerably tinged with Dempster’s scepticism.
Sir David Dalrymple, who had formerly sought to rescue him
from the Scylla of credulity, was now attempting his deliverance
from the Charybdis of doubt. Boswell on the 3rd August communicated
with Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“To-morrow morning, at five o’clock, I set out upon my
travels. I am much hurried with putting all my things in order.
I have left some parcels in one of the drawers, which I beg you
will keep for me till I return. I have been a great deal with
Mr. Johnson of late, and (would you believe it?) his friendship
for me is so great that he insists on seeing me sail, and has
actually taken a place in the coach to accompany me to
Harwich.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the “Life of Johnson” the narrative is continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Friday, August 5, we set out early in the morning in the
Harwich stage-coach. A fat elderly gentlewoman and a young
Dutchman seemed the most inclined among us to conversation.
At the inn where we dined, the gentlewoman said that she had
done her best to educate her children; and particularly that she
had never suffered them to be a moment idle. <i>Johnson</i>: ‘I wish
madam, you would educate me too; for I have been an idle
fellow all my life.’ ‘I am sure, sir,’ said she, ‘you have not
been idle.’ <i>Johnson</i>: ‘Nay, madam, it is very true; and that
gentleman there,’ pointing to me, ‘has been idle. He was idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
at Edinburgh. His father sent him to Glasgow, where he
continued to be idle. He then came to London, where he has
been very idle; and now he is going to Utrecht, where he will
be as idle as ever.’ I asked him privately how he could expose
me so. <i>Johnson</i>: ‘Pooh! pooh!’ said he; ‘they know nothing
about you, and will think of it no more.’ ... Next
day we got to Harwich to dinner; and my passage in the
packet-boat to Helvoetsluys being secured, and my baggage put
on board, we dined at an inn by ourselves.... We went
and looked at the church, and having gone into it, and walked
up to the altar, Johnson, whose piety was constant and fervent,
sent me to my knees, saying, ‘Now that you are going to leave
your native country, recommend yourself to the protection of
your Creator and Redeemer.’ ... My revered friend
walked down with me to the beach, where we embraced and
parted with tenderness, and engaged to correspond by letters. I
said, ‘I hope, sir, you will not forget me in my absence.’ <i>Johnson</i>:
‘Nay, sir, it is more likely that you should forget me than
that I should forget you.’ As the vessel put out to sea I kept my
eyes upon him for a considerable time, while he remained rolling
his majestic frame in his usual manner; and at last I perceived
him walk back into the town, and he disappeared.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 8th December Dr. Johnson addressed to Boswell his
first letter. He entreated him to study civil law as his father
had advised, and the ancient languages, as he had personally
resolved upon. He then proceeds to depict his friend’s weaknesses
in these forcible terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You know a gentleman, who when first he set his foot
in the gay world, as he prepared himself to whirl in the
vortex of pleasure, imagined a total indifference and universal
negligence to be the most agreeable concomitants of youth, and
the strongest indication of an easy temper and a quick apprehension.
Vacant to every object, and sensible of every impulse,
he thought that an appearance of diligence would deduct
something from the reputation of genius, and hoped that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
should appear to attain, amidst all the ease of carelessness, and
all the tumult of diversion, that knowledge and those accomplishments
which mortals of the common fabric obtain only by
mute abstraction and solitary drudgery. He tried this scheme
of life awhile, was made weary of it by his sense and his virtue;
he then wished to return to his studies, and finding long habits
of idleness and pleasure harder to be cured than he expected,
still wishing to retain his claim to some extraordinary prerogatives,
resolved the common consequences of irregularity into an
unalterable decree of destiny, and concluded that nature had
originally formed him incapable of rational enjoyment. Let all
such fancies, illusive and destructive, be banished henceforward
from your thoughts for ever. Resolve and keep your resolution;
choose, and pursue your choice. If you spend this day in study,
you will find yourself still more able to study to-morrow; not
that you are to expect that you shall at once obtain a complete
victory.”</p>

<p class="p1">Johnson had commended his friend for keeping a journal.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
He concludes his letter by expressing a hope that he is “enriching
his journal with many observations upon the country” in
which he was residing.</p>

<p>At Utrecht Boswell obtained the friendship of M. Trotz, the
learned civilian, whose prelections on civil law he attended for
some months. He also became intimate with the Rev. William
Brown, pastor of the English congregation at Utrecht, subsequently
Professor of Church History at St. Andrews. Anecdotes
related by M. Trotz and Mr. Brown are preserved in Boswell’s
Commonplace-book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Auchinleck had designed that his son should prosecute
his studies at Utrecht for two years. The proposal was not a
hopeful one, and it was not realized. Before his first term was
completed, Boswell longed for the pleasures of travel: as the
term closed he hastened into the country. He visited Leyden
and other noted localities in the Netherlands, and passed into
Germany. He reached Berlin in July, where he delivered a letter
of introduction to Mr., afterwards Sir Andrew Mitchell, British
Ambassador at the Prussian Court. By this accomplished
gentleman he was well received and hospitably entertained.
From Berlin he wrote a letter to his father, expatiating on the
advantages of travel, and entreating that such a remittance
might be sent him as would carry him into Switzerland, and
from thence into Italy. Pending his father’s answer, he visited
the duchies of Hanover and Brunswick. Returning to Berlin
on the 27th of August he found a letter from his father, strongly
disapproving his proposal for a lengthened tour, and allowing
him only the indulgence of visiting France before resuming his
legal studies at Utrecht. Mortified by his father’s decision,
and the severely peremptory character of his letter, he thought
of waiting on Mr. Mitchell to entreat his aid and intervention.
The ambassador was from home; he had gone with his family
to Spa, where he was still to remain some weeks. Procuring
his address, Boswell sent him a lengthened communication,
which owing to its peculiar manner we present without
abridgment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“You may believe, sir, that I was a good deal surprised to
hear, upon my return to Berlin, that <i>onze Gezant</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> was gone.
There was indeed a surmise at Brunswick that you intended to
return to England this season. I was asked if it was true, and
very innocently affirmed that there was nothing in it. I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
however, that when a man leaves a Minister at a foreign Court
but for a fortnight, he is not sure of finding him upon his return.
Your departure is a good deal unlucky for me, not only as it
deprives me of conversation which gave me uncommon pleasure,
and invariably accustomed me to rational thinking and honourable
sentiment, but because I now particularly stand in need of
your prudent and kind counsel with respect to my travels. I
have had another letter from my father, in which he continues
of opinion that travelling is of very little use, and may do a great
deal of harm. I shall not repeat what I have formerly said of
my father’s particular character; I say <i>particular</i>, for rarely
will you find a man of so excellent a frame of body, and so
noble a mind as to have passed through life with uniform propriety
of conduct.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> For my own part, I own that I am not
such a favourite of nature. Think not that I intend to plead
machinery, and escape from the censure due to the faults which
I have committed. I only would have you consider that judgment
is a natural gift as well as imagination, and force of mind
is in a great measure independent of our endeavours: think of
me as I am, and pronounce accordingly.</p>

<p>“I esteem and love my father, and I am determined to do
what is in my power to make him easy and happy; but you
will allow that I may endeavour to make him happy and at the
same time not be too hard upon myself. I must use you so
much with the freedom of a friend as to tell you that, with the
vivacity which you allowed me, I have a melancholy disposition.
To escape from the gloom of dark speculation, I have made
excursions into the fields of amusement, perhaps of folly. I
have found that amusement and folly are beneath me, and that
without some laudable pursuit my life must be insipid and
wearisome. I therefore took the resolution of leaving London,
and settled myself for the winter at Utrecht, where I recovered
my inclination for study and rational thinking. I then laid my
account with travelling for a couple of years, but I found my
father’s views to be entirely different. You saw the letter which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I wrote him from this, and I flatter myself that you approved of
it. I cannot expect his answer for some weeks; in the meantime
he tells me that he would not oppose my passing another
winter at Utrecht, so that he does not grudge the time which
I ask. As for the money, I should think for one year a little
extraordinary expense is not thrown away, when it is also to be
considered that what I spend now I shall not have some years
hence. My father seems much against my going to Italy, but
gives me leave to go from there and pass some months in Paris.
I own that the words of the apostle Paul, “I must see Rome,”
are strongly borne in upon my mind; it would give me infinite
pleasure; it would give me talk for a lifetime, and I should go
home to Auchinleck with serene contentment. I am no libertine,
and have a moral certainty of suffering no harm in Italy;
I can also assure you that I shall be as moderate as possible in
my expenses. I do not intend to travel as <i>Mi Lord Anglois</i>, but
merely as a scholar and a man of elegant curiosity, and I am
told that in that character I may live in Italy very reasonably.
I obviate your objection of my being obliged to live like others,
by assuring you that I have none of that second-rate ambition
which actuates most young men of fortune upon their travels.
After passing four months on classic ground, I would come
through France, and go home, as I said to my father, <i>uti conviva
satur</i>.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, tell me fairly if I am unreasonable. Upon my
honour I cannot think that I am. I give you my word that
my father’s inclinations shall be as inviolable laws to his son;
but don’t you think that I may just remonstrate before I consider
an act as passed? Don’t you think that, rather than go
home contrary to what I much desire, and cannot help thinking
very proper,&mdash;don’t you think it worth while to humour me so
far as to allow me my year and a reasonable sum, after which
I return clear and contented, without any pretence for my
stormy disposition to murmur at? I would beg, sir, that you
may write to my father your opinion as to this matter, and put it
in the light that you think it deserves. In the meantime I can see
little advantage to be had at Berlin. I shall, however, remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
here a fortnight, after which I intend passing by Mannheim,
and one or two more of the German Courts, to Geneva; I am
then at the point from which I may either steer to Italy or to
France. I shall see Voltaire. I shall also see Switzerland and
Rousseau; these two men are to me greater objects than most
statues or pictures. I take this opportunity to assure the loved
and respected friend of my father that I am serenely happy at
having obtained his acquaintance. I would hope that I shall
not be found unworthy of his regard, and I wish very honestly
for an opportunity of showing my real esteem for such a character
as I could draw to any one else but to himself.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">In a postscript Boswell begged an early reply. His letter,
somewhat Johnsonian in style, actually reflected some of Dr.
Johnson’s sentiments respecting himself, in the letter received at
Utrecht. It was sufficiently candid to induce friendship, and
not more ambitious than the ardour of youth might have excused
or justified. But Mr. Mitchell had no desire to arbitrate between
father and son in a matter with which he was personally unconcerned.
He contented himself with administering to the young
traveller a lecture on filial obedience, and declined all further
negotiation. Lord Auchinleck meanwhile relented without
further pressure, assented to the Italian project, and sent the
necessary funds. To the Ambassador Boswell addressed a letter
from Geneva on the 26th December; it commenced in a style
sufficiently exultant:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I thank you for your letter from Spa, although it gave me
no great encouragement in my scheme of going to Italy. You
tell me gravely to follow the plan which my father prescribed,
whatever it may be, and in doing so I shall certainly act most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
wisely. I forgive you this, for I say just the same to young
people when I advise. To enter into detail of the little circumstances
which compose the felicity of another, is what a man of
any genius can hardly submit to. We therefore give a good,
wholesome, general counsel; and he who consults us thinks a
little, and then endeavours to take his own way as well as he
can. I have, however, the happiness to inform you that my
father has consented that I shall go to Italy. Upon my soul, I
am grateful to the most worthy of men: it will be hard if we are
not well together, for I love him with the strongest affection.
If I find that I cannot succeed in my own plans in such a way
as to convince my father that I am in the right, I shall do my
utmost to fulfil the plan beyond which he cannot think to look.
You may suppose what my ideas are, for they are of your old
acquaintances. One thing I am sure of, and by the undisguised
honour of a man of probity I swear, shall chiefly influence me&mdash;a
regard to the happiness of him to whom I owe so much,
Believe me I have a soul.”</p>

<p class="p1">Had Boswell concluded his letter at this point he might have
merited some praise for snubbing the ambassador who had
lectured him on filial duty. But he goes on to entreat
Mr. Mitchell’s influence on behalf of the father and brother of
his friend Mr. Temple. The father he describes as formerly an
officer in the Customs, who had forfeited his appointment
by becoming insolvent. The son, Master Robert, is now a
lieutenant on half-pay. Through Mr. Mitchell he desires a
Government post for the one, and full pay for the other. He
assures the ambassador that excepting his Sovereign he is “the
only man in Britain” he would ask a favour of. “If you can
aid me,” he adds, “you will most truly oblige a worthy fellow,
for such I am.” To this second communication the ambassador
vouchsafed no answer.</p>

<p>Through a part of Germany Boswell was accompanied
by the Earl Marischal, who ordinarily resided at Berlin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
who had, during a recent visit to Scotland, formed the acquaintance
of Lord Auchinleck. With introductions from his lordship
he visited Voltaire at Ferney, and Rousseau in the
wilds of Neufchatel. It is to be regretted that he did not
record his conversations with these celebrated persons. Crossing
the Alps, he visited the principal towns of Italy. He spent
some time in Italy with Lord Mountstuart, eldest son of the
Earl of Bute. To this nobleman he dedicated his thesis when
he was called to the Bar.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Corsica were at this time engaged against
the Genoese in their memorable struggle for liberty, and Pascal
Paoli, their patriotic leader, had become celebrated over Europe.
To Boswell he had been warmly commended by Rousseau, who
had corresponded with the Corsicans respecting the formation of
their laws. Boswell hinted to Rousseau that he might proceed to
Corsica, and when in April, 1765, he reached Rome, he addressed
a letter to the philosopher, begging an introduction to Paoli.
Not receiving a reply, he wrote to Rousseau a second time,
informing him that should he withhold the introduction sought
for “he should certainly go without it, and probably be hanged
as a spy.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> On his arrival at Florence, in August, he received
a letter from “the wild philosopher,” recommending him first to
Mr. Buttafoco, Captain of the Royal Italian Regiment at
Viscovado, and in his absence to General Paoli. At Leghorn
he procured from Count Rivarola, the Sardinian Consul, a
special letter to Paoli and other leading persons at Corsica.</p>

<p>Arriving in the island, Boswell was courteously received by
Signor Antonetti, to whom he presented a letter from Count
Rivarola. After entertaining him at his house, Antonetti
facilitated his progress to the town of Sollacarò, the headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of Paoli. On his route Boswell heard that in the
castle of Corte were detained three murderers, a woman and
two men; he gratified his curiosity by conversing with them.
At his request the executioner was also presented to him.</p>

<p>Reaching Sollacarò, Boswell was brought into the presence of
Paoli, to whom he handed his credentials. Paoli received him
with reserve, but afterwards became friendly. To the general
he described himself in these terms:&mdash;“With a mind naturally
inclined to melancholy, and a keen desire of inquiry, I have
intensely applied myself to metaphysical researches, and
reasoned beyond my depth on such subjects as it is not given
to man to know. I have rendered my mind a comera (<i>sic</i>)
obscura; in the very heat of youth I felt the <i>non est tanti</i>,
the <i>omnia vanitas</i> of one who has exhausted all the sweets of
his being, and is weary with dull repetition. I told him that
I had almost become for ever incapable of taking a part in
active life.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Paoli introduced Boswell to his nobility, who severally
honoured him with visits. He was one day mounted on Paoli’s
horse, with its rich garniture of crimson velvet and gold lace.
In journeying he was attended by the general’s guards, an
honour from which he “enjoyed a sort of luxury of noble sentiment.”
From Paoli’s palace at Corte, the capital of Corsica, he
addressed a letter to Dr. Johnson, which he describes as “full
of generous enthusiasm.” Having related what he had done
and seen, he summed up; “I dare to call this a spirited tour;
I dare to challenge your approbation.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>From Corsica Boswell communicated to Rousseau, now in
France, the details of his visit to Paoli, and on his reaching
Paris received the philosopher’s commands to bring with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
into England, whither he had preceded him, the notorious
companion of his household, Therése La Vasseur. Boswell
accepted the mission, and accompanied Rousseau’s mistress from
Paris to London. In reference to his intended progress, Mr.
Hume, at whose instance Rousseau proceeded to England, thus
communicated with his ingenious correspondent, the Countess
de Bouflers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>12th of January, 1766.</i></p>

<p>“A letter has come open to me from Guy, the bookseller,
by which I learn that Mademoiselle<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> sets out first in company
with a friend of mine, a young gentleman very good-humoured,
very agreeable, and very mad. He visited Rousseau in his
mountains, who gave him a recommendation to Paoli, the King
of Corsica; where this gentleman, whose name is Boswell, went
last summer in search of adventures. He has such a rage for
literature, that I dread some event fatal to our friend’s honour.
For remember the story of Terentia, who was first married to
Cicero, then to Sallust, and at last, in her old age, married a
young nobleman, who imagined that she must possess some
secret which would convey to him eloquence and genius.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">At Paris, in the house of Mr. Waters, an English banker,
Boswell found a letter from Dr. Johnson, dated the 14th January.
It proceeded thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Be assured for the present, that nothing has lessened either
the esteem or love with which I dismissed you at Harwich. Both
have been increased by all that I have been told of you by
yourself or others, and when you return, you will return to an
unaltered and, I hope, unalterable friend.</p>

<p>“All that you have to fear from me is the vexation of disappointing
me. No man loves to frustrate expectations which
have been formed in his favour; and the pleasure which I
promise myself from your journals and remarks is so great, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
perhaps no degree of attention or discernment will be sufficient
to afford it.</p>

<p>“Come home, however, and take your chance. I long to see
you and to hear you, and hope that we shall not be so long
separated again. Come home, and expect such welcome as is
due to him whom a wise and noble curiosity has led where
perhaps, no native of this country ever was before.</p>

<p class="pc ls2">******</p>

<p>“As your father’s liberality has indulged you with so long a
ramble, I doubt not but that you will think his sickness, or even his
desire to see you, a sufficient reason for hastening your return.
The longer we live, and the more we think, the higher value we
learn to put on the friendship and tenderness of parents and
friends. Parents we can have but once; and he promises himself
too much who enters life with the expectation of finding many
friends. Upon some motive I hope that you will be here soon,
and am willing to think that it will be an inducement to your
return that it is sincerely desired by, dear sir, your affectionate
humble servant,</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Sam Johnson</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Boswell reached London in the beginning of February, and
at once visited Dr. Johnson at his house in Johnson’s Court.
Received with much cordiality, he proceeded to entertain the
lexicographer with Voltaire’s opinions of some of the English
poets. In the evening the friends supped together at the Mitre
Tavern, when Boswell learnt, for the first time, that Johnson
had become practically an abstainer. On Saturday, the 15th
February, Boswell and Johnson again met at the “Mitre,” the
former being accompanied by his friend Mr. Temple. Boswell
spoke of Rousseau, and said he had met with Mr. Wilkes
in Italy, and had enjoyed his society. Johnson denounced both
the philosopher and the politician in his severest manner.</p>

<p>In the course of their conversation General Paoli had remarked
to Boswell that he might inform the members of his court that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Corsicans were worthy of greater support than they had hitherto
received. Boswell construed the remark into a request, and,
before he left the island, commissioned a Corsican dress in
which he might, to members of the English Cabinet, plead the
cause of Paoli. In this costume he waited on several members
of Government, and some noted politicians. From Mr.
Walpole he experienced a courteous reception. Mr. Pitt wrote
him a short letter, which, in the hope of producing a correspondence
between him and the minister, he acknowledged as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1 pr2">“<i>St. James’ Street, Feb. 19, 1766.</i></p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to receive your most obliging letter,
and can with difficulty restrain myself from paying you compliments
on the very genteel manner in which you are pleased
to treat me. But I come from a people among whom even the
lowest arts of insinuation are unknown. However you may, by
political circumstances, be in one view a simple individual, yet,
sir, Mr. Pitt will always be the prime minister of the brave, the
secretary of freedom and of spirit; and I hope that I may with
propriety talk to him of the views of the illustrious Paoli. Be
that as it may, I shall very much value the honour of being
admitted to your acquaintance.</p>

<p class="pr4">“I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">James Boswell</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Informed of his mother’s death, Boswell left London for
Auchinleck. His father was pleased to find him somewhat less
volatile, and quite reconciled to the legal profession. On the
26th July he was admitted advocate. His “Thesis on Civil
Law,” published at his admission, he transmitted to Dr. Johnson,
who criticised it with severity; he, however, heartily commended
his resolution to obey his father, and seriously to occupy himself
with business. His proposal to write a history of Corsica
Dr. Johnson objected to. “You have,” he wrote, “no materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which others have not, or may have. You have, somehow or
other, warmed your imagination. I wish there were some cure,
like the lover’s leap, for all heads of which some single idea has
obtained an unreasonable and irregular possession. Mind your
own affairs, and leave the Corsicans to theirs.”</p>

<p>Aware of Boswell’s tendency to form resolutions, which he
afterwards departed from, Dr. Johnson entreated him to abandon
his practice of vow-making. To a letter from the lexicographer
on this subject Boswell made the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>Auchinleck, 6th November, 1766.</i></p>

<p>“Might I venture to differ from you with regard to the
utility of vows? I am sensible that it may be very dangerous
to make vows rashly, and without a due consideration. But I
cannot help thinking that they may often be of great advantage
to one of a variable judgment and irregular inclinations.
I always remember a passage in one of your letters to our
Italian friend, Baretti; where, talking of the monastic life, you
say you do not wonder that serious men should put themselves
under the protection of a religious order, when they have found
how unable they are to take care of themselves. For my own
part, without affecting to be a Socrates, I am sure I have a more
than ordinary struggle to maintain with the Evil Principle; and
all the methods I can devise are little enough to keep me
tolerably steady in the paths of rectitude.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In February, 1767, Boswell conveyed his congratulations to
Mr. Temple on his being admitted to priest’s orders, and instituted
Rector of Mamhead. The following remarks with which
his congratulations were accompanied would have reflected credit
on Dr. Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am sincerely happy that you are at length the Reverend
Mr. Temple. I view the profession of a clergyman in an amiable
and respectable light. Don’t be moved by declamations against
ecclesiastical history, as if that could blacken the sacred order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
I confess that it is not in ecclesiastical history that we find the
most agreeable account of divines: their politics, their ambition,
and their cruelty are there displayed; but remember, Temple,
you are there reading the vices of only political divines,&mdash;of
such individuals as in so numerous a body have been very unworthy
members of the Church, and should have rather been
employed in the rudest secular concerns. But if you would
judge fairly of the priests of Jesus, you must consider how
many of the distressed they have comforted, how many of the
wicked they have reclaimed, how many of the good they have
improved; consider the lives of thousands of worthy pious
divines who have been a blessing to their parishes. This is
just, Temple. You say the truths of morality are written in the
hearts of all men, and they find it their interest to practise them.
My dear friend, will you believe a specious moral essayist
against your own experience? Don’t you in the very same
letter complain of the wickedness of those around you? Don’t
you talk of the tares in society? My friend, it is your office to
labour cheerfully in the vineyard, and, if possible, to leave not
a tare in Mamhead.</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><span class="ls3">*****</span></p>

<p class="pbq">“In a word, my dear Temple, be a good clergyman, and you
will be happy both here and hereafter.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell proceeds to advise his friend to marry a suitable
wife, and expresses a regret that he himself cannot wed so long
as his father lives. Having administered these virtuous
counsels, he intimates that he has involved himself in an illicit
amour&mdash;or, as he expresses it, that he is attached to “a dear
infidel.” The person so described was a married woman, who
had separated from her husband. Boswell had met her in the
autumn of 1765 at Moffat Spa, where he had been sojourning
with his friend Mr. Johnston, of Grange, a Dumfriesshire
landowner. He had brought her to Edinburgh, and she was
now maintained at his expense. In mitigation of his conduct
in associating with her, he thus expatiates to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Don’t think her unfaithful; I could not love her if she was.
There is baseness in all deceit which my soul is virtuous enough
to abhor, and therefore I look with horror on adultery. But
my amiable mistress is no longer bound to him who was her
husband: he has used her shockingly ill; he has deserted her;
he lives with another. Is she not then free? She is, it is clear,
and no arguments can disguise it. She is now mine; and were
she to be unfaithful to me, she ought to be pierced with a Corsican
poniard; but I believe she loves me sincerely. She has done
everything to please me: she is perfectly generous, and would
not hear of any present.”</p>

<p class="p1">The first part of Boswell’s letter embracing these incongruous
details is dated “1st February,” and occupies seven folio pages.
With temporary discretion the writer hesitated to send off so
strange a communication; at length, on the 28th of the month,
he resumed his narrative, which after another interval was concluded
on the 4th March, and thereupon despatched. Respecting
his unhappy amour he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have talked a great deal of my sweet little mistress; I am,
however, uneasy about her. Furnishing a house and maintaining
her with a maid will cost me a great deal of money, and it
is too like marriage, or too much a settled plan of licentiousness;
but what can I do? I have already taken the house, and
the lady has agreed to go in at Whitsuntide; I cannot in honour
draw back.... Now am I tormented because my charmer
has formerly loved others. Besides, she is ill-bred, quite a
rompish girl. She debases my dignity; she has no refinement,
but she is very handsome and very lively. What is it to me
that she has formerly loved? so have I. I am positive that
since I first courted her at Moffat she has been constant to me;
she is kind, she is generous. What shall I do? I wish I could
get off; and yet how awkward would it be!... What is
to be thought of this life, my friend? Hear the story of my last
three days. After tormenting myself with reflecting on my
charmer’s former loves, and ruminating on parting with her, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
went to her. I could not conceal my being distressed. I told
her I was very unhappy, but I would not tell her why. She
took this very seriously, and was so much affected that she went
next morning and gave up her house. I went in the afternoon
and secured the house, and then drank tea with her. She was
much agitated; she said she was determined to go and board
herself in the north of England, and that I used her very ill. I
expostulated with her; I was sometimes inclined to let her go,
and sometimes my heart was like to burst within me. I held
her dear hand; her eyes were full of passion; I told her what
made me miserable; she was pleased to find it was nothing
worse. She had imagined I was suspicious of her fidelity, and
she thought that very ungenerous in reconsidering her behaviour.
She said I should not mind her faults before I knew her, since
her conduct was now more circumspect. She owned that she
loved me more than she had ever done her husband. All was
well again.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell went out, and the same evening got drunk, and committed
gross follies. On the 30th March he wrote to Mr. Temple
from Auchinleck. He informed him that as his Circe had gone
to Moffat, he has “had time to think coolly,” and to call up
“that reason which he had so often contradicted.” He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“Johnston, an old friend of mine, a writer in Edinburgh, but
too much of an indolent philosopher to have great business, being
rather a worthy country gentleman, with a paternal estate of
£100 a year, was much distressed with my unhappy passion.
He was at Moffat when it first began, and he marked the advance
of the fever. It was he who assured me, upon his honour, that
my fair one had a very bad character, and gave me some
instances which made my lovesick heart recoil. He had some
influence with me, but my brother David had more. To him I
discovered my weakness, my slavery, and begged his advice. He
gave it me like a man. I gloried in him. I roused all my
spirit, and at last I was myself again. I immediately wrote her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a letter, of which I enclose the scroll for your perusal. She and
I have always corresponded in such a manner that no mischief
could come of it, for we supposed a Miss&mdash;&mdash;, to whom all
my amorous vows were paid.... I have not yet got her
answer: what will it be, think you? I shall judge of her character
from it. I shall see if she is abandoned or virtuous; I
mean both in a degree; I shall at any rate be free. What a
snare have I escaped! Do you remember Ulysses and
Circe?&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">‘Sub domina meretrice vixisset turpis et excors.’</p>

<p class="p1">“My life is one of the most romantic that I believe either
you or I really know of, and yet I am a very sensible, good
sort of man. What is the meaning of this, Temple? You may
depend upon it that very soon my follies will be at an end, and
I shall turn out an admirable member of society. Now that I
have given my mind the turn, I am totally emancipated from
my charmer, as much as from the gardener’s daughter who now
puts on my fire and performs menial offices like any other
wench, and yet just this time twelvemonth I was so madly in
love as to think of marrying her. Should not this be an
everlasting lesson to me?... How strangely do we colour
over our vices! I startle when you talk of keeping another man’s
wife, yet that was literally my scheme, though imagination
represented it just as being fond of a pretty, lovely, black little
lady, who to oblige me stayed in Edinburgh, and I very genteelly
paid her expenses.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">From several letters to Mr. Temple at subsequent dates, it
appears that Boswell’s discreditable amour was protracted for
some time longer. In the same letter he invited his friend’s
counsel respecting certain matrimonial projects on which he
had embarked.</p>

<p>Amidst his dissipations and follies Boswell was not altogether
idle. To Mr. Temple he reported, in March, that he had at
the Bar earned sixty-five guineas during the winter, and that
his employment was steadily on the increase. He stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Mr. Hume augured favourably of his work on Corsica; that
Rousseau had quarrelled with him as he had done with Hume;
that Dr. Gregory had sought his acquaintance, and that he
had received a long letter from General Paoli, and one of three
pages from Lord Chatham.</p>

<p>To Lord Chatham Boswell replied in characteristic fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>Auchinleck, April 8th, 1767.</i></p>

<p>“I have communicated to General Paoli the contents of your
lordship’s letter, and I am persuaded he will think as I do....
Your lordship applauds my ‘generous warmth for so striking a
character as the able chief.’ Indeed, my lord, I have the happiness
of being able to contemplate with supreme delight those
distinguished spirits by which God is sometimes pleased to
honour humanity, and as I have no personal favour to ask of
your lordship, I will tell you, with the confidence of one who
does not fear to be thought a flatterer, that your character, my
lord, has filled many of my best hours with that noble admiration
which a disinterested soul can enjoy in the bower of philosophy.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">After informing his correspondent that he is about to publish
an account of Corsica, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“As for myself, to please a worthy and respected father,
one of our Scots judges, I studied law, and am now fairly
entered to the bar. I begin to like it; I can labour hard, I feel
myself coming forward, and I hope to be useful to my country.
Could your lordship find time to honour me now and then with
a letter?</p>

<p class="pbq">“I have been told how favourably your lordship has spoken of
me. To correspond with a Paoli and with a Chatham is enough
to keep a young man ever ardent in the pursuit of virtuous
fame.”</p>

<p class="p1">The cool egotism which prompted Boswell, an undistinguished
youth, to beg an occasional letter from an illustrious and veteran
statesman is without a parallel in biography. At Edinburgh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
notwithstanding his obvious eccentricity, he enjoyed a kind of
literary <i>status</i>. As a patron of histrionic art he led a considerable
section of the Edinburgh youth; and we have already
related, that at the request of Ross, the player, he composed the
prologue spoken at the opening of the Edinburgh theatre in
December, 1767. By an act of indiscretion he nearly crushed
the institution he had helped to rear. He brought on the Edinburgh
stage a comedy entitled “The Coquettes,” to oblige Lady
Houston, by whom it was composed. On the third performance
it was condemned as a bad translation of one of Corneille’s
worst plays. Lady Houston was sister of Lord Cathcart,
one of Boswell’s friends, and creditably enough he was content
to bear the censure of producing the piece rather than expose
the foolish gentlewoman who had placed it in his hands.</p>

<p>In his letter to Mr. Temple of the 30th March, 1767, he reports
concerning his forthcoming venture&mdash;“I am now seriously
engaged in my account of Corsica; it elevates my soul, and
makes me <i>spernere humum</i>. I shall have it finished by June.”
Through Mr. Hume he endeavoured to secure Mr. Andrew Millar
as publisher; but negotiations being unsatisfactory, he sold his
MS. for 100 guineas to Messrs. Edward and Charles Dilly, booksellers
in the Poultry. In an ordinary octavo the work appeared
in the spring of 1768, with the title, “An Account of Corsica: the
Journal of a Tour to that Island, and Memoirs of Pascal Paoli, by
James Boswell, Esq.” It was dedicated, in flattering terms, to
Paoli; but the peculiarities of the writer were more apparent in his
preface. He there indicates his peculiar system of orthography.
“Of late,” he writes, “it has become the fashion to render our
language more neat and trim by leaving out k after c, and u in
the last syllable of words which used to end in our. The illustrious
Mr. Samuel Johnson, who has alone executed in England
what was the task of whole academies in other countries, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
been careful in his dictionary to preserve the k as a mark of
Saxon original. He has for most part, too, been careful to preserve
the u, but he has also omitted it in several words. I have
retained the k, and have taken upon me to follow a general rule
with regard to words ending in our. Wherever a word originally
Latin has been transmitted to us through the medium of the
French I have written it with the characteristical u. Our
attention to this may appear trivial, but I own I am one of
those who are curious in the formation of language in its various
modes; and therefore, with that, the affinity of English with
other tongues may not be forgotten. If this work should at any
future period be reprinted, I hope that care will be taken of my
orthography.”</p>

<p>Pursuant to his system, Boswell indulged the satisfaction of
writing <i>authour</i> for author, and <i>tremenduous</i> for a word known
only as tremendous. He closed his preface by intimating his
literary aspirations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I should,” he writes, “be proud to be known as an authour,
and I have an ardent ambition for literary fame; for of all possessions
I should imagine literary fame to be the most valuable. A
man who has been able to furnish a book which has been approved
by the world has established himself as a respectable character
in distant society, without any danger of having that character
lessened by the observation of his weaknesses. To preserve an
uniform dignity among those who see us every day is hardly
possible, and to aim at it must put us under the fetters of a
perpetual restraint. The authour of an approved book may
allow his natural disposition an easy play, and yet indulge the
pride of superior genius when he considers that by those who
know him only as an authour he never ceases to be respected.
Such an authour, when in his hours of gloom and discontent,
may have the consolation to think that his writings are at that
very time giving pleasure to numbers, and such an authour may
cherish the hope of being remembered after death, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
been a great object to the noblest minds in all ages. Whether
I may merit any portion of literary fame the public will judge.
Whatever my ambition may be, I trust that my confidence is not
too great, nor my hopes too sanguine.”</p>

<p class="p1">Though subjected to some ridicule, owing to the extreme
egotism of the writer, the Corsican Journey was well received.
A second edition was called for within a few months. Boswell
proceeded to London to enjoy an anticipated ovation. When he
arrived Dr. Johnson was on a visit at Oxford, but Boswell by
letter solicited his commendation. Contrary to his hopes he
received this laconic answer&mdash;“I wish you would empty your
head of Corsica, which I think has filled it rather too long.”
From Dr. Johnson such a reproof was intolerable. Boswell at
once despatched the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“How can you bid me empty my head of Corsica? My
noble-minded friend, do you not feel for an oppressed nation
bravely struggling to be free? Consider fairly what is the case.
The Corsicans never received any kindness from the Genoese.
They never agreed to be subject to them. They owe them
nothing, and when reduced to an abject state of slavery by
force, shall they not rise in the great cause of liberty, and break
the galling yoke? And shall not every liberal soul be warm for
them? Empty my head of Corsica! Empty it of honour,
empty it of humanity, empty it of friendship, empty it of
piety. No! while I live, Corsica and the cause of the brave
islanders shall ever employ much of my attention, shall ever
interest me in the sincerest manner.”</p>

<p class="p1">Though Dr. Johnson imparted no praise, Boswell, on account
of his book, met with considerable attention. To Mr. Temple
he wrote on the 14th May,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am really the great man now. I have had David Hume
in the forenoon, and Mr. Johnson in the afternoon of the same
day visiting me. Sir John Pringle, Dr. Franklin, and some
more company, dined with me to-day; and Mr. Johnson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
General Oglethorpe one day, Mr. Garrick alone another, and
David Hume and some more <i>literati</i>, dine with me next
week. I give admirable dinners and good claret; and the
moment I go abroad again, which will be in a day or two, I set
up my chariot. This is enjoying the fruit of my labours, and
appearing like the friend of Paoli. By-the-bye, the Earl of
Pembroke and Captain Meadows are just setting out for Corsica,
and I have the honour of introducing them by letter to the
General. David Hume came on purpose the other day to tell
me that the Duke of Bedford was very fond of my book, and
had recommended it to the Duchess.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the beginning of 1769 Boswell issued under the publishing
auspices of Messrs. Dilly, a duodecimo volume entitled
“British Essays in favour of the brave Corsicans”&mdash;a work
which was followed by the third edition of his work on Corsica.
In a preface to this edition, dated at Auchinleck, 29th October,
1768, he thus disposes of his critics:&mdash;“To those who
have imagined themselves very witty in sneering at me for
being a Christian, I would recommend the serious study of
theology; and I hope they will attain to the same comfort that
I have in the belief of a revelation by which a Saviour is
proclaimed to the world, and ‘life and immortality are clearly
brought to light.’” He closes by congratulating himself on
having obtained literary reputation.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“May I be permitted to say,” he writes, “that the success
of this book has exceeded my warmest hopes. When I first
ventured to send it into the world I fairly owned an ardent
desire for literary fame. I have obtained my desire; and
whatever clouds may overcast my days, I can now walk here
among the rocks and woods of my ancestors with an agreeable
consciousness that I have done something worthy.”</p>

<p class="p1">Complacently as he had expressed himself, Boswell was ill
at ease, for though his book sold, and was generally approved,
Dr. Johnson remained silent. After enduring the affront for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
eighteen months, he at length, in September, 1769, addressed
a letter to the lexicographer, charging him with unkindness.
In these terms Dr. Johnson rebutted the accusation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Why do you charge me with unkindness? I have omitted
nothing that could do you good or give you pleasure, unless
it be that I have forborne to tell you my opinion of your
‘Account of Corsica.’ I believe my opinion, if you think
well of my judgment, might have given you pleasure; but
when it is considered how much vanity is excited by praise,
I am not sure that it would have done you good. Your history
is like other histories, but your journal is in a very high degree
curious and delightful. There is between the history and the
journal that difference which there will always be found between
notions borrowed from without and notions generated within.
Your history was copied from books; your journal rose out of
your own experience and observation. You express images
which operated strongly upon yourself, and you have impressed
them with great force upon your readers. I know not whether
I could name any narrative by which curiosity is better excited
or better gratified.”</p>

<p class="p1">These words from Dr. Johnson made Boswell happy. The
Doctor’s opinion as to the interest of the work mainly depending
on the narrative of the writer’s own experiences was shared
generally. Respecting Boswell and his performance, Mr.
Walpole, in a letter to the poet Gray, dated 18th February,
1768, thus expresses himself:&mdash;“Pray read the new account of
Corsica; what relates to Paoli will amuse you much. There is a
deal about the island and its dimensions that one does not care
a straw for. The author, Boswell, is a strange being, and, like
Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> has a rage for knowing anybody that was ever talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of. He forced himself upon me in spite of my teeth and my
doors, and I see has given a foolish account of all he could pick
up from me about King Theodore. He then took an antipathy
to me on Rousseau’s account, abused me in the newspapers, and
expected Rousseau to do so too; but as he came to see me no
more, I forgave all the rest. I see he is now a little sick of
Rousseau himself, but I hope it will not cure him of his anger
to me; however, his book will amuse you.”</p>

<p>This is caustic enough. Gray’s reply is equally in praise of
Boswell’s Journal and condemnatory of its author:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>Pembroke College, February 25, 1768.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Boswell’s book I was going to recommend to you when
I received your letter. It has pleased and moved me strangely&mdash;all
(I mean) that relates to Paoli.... The pamphlet
proves what I have always maintained, that any fool may write
a most valuable book by chance, if he will only tell us what he
heard and said with veracity. Of Mr. Boswell’s truth I have
not the least suspicion, because I am sure he could invent
nothing of the kind. The title of this part of his work is a
dialogue between a Green Goose and a Hero.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Inflated with his success as an author, and his supposed popularity
as the friend of the Corsicans and of Paoli, Boswell, on his
return to Edinburgh in the summer of 1768, began to eschew his
legal duties and spend his evenings at the gambling-table. To
this practice he had been formerly addicted, but he had temporarily
renounced it, on the counsel of Mr. Sheridan. In August,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
1768, he reported to Mr. Temple that “he found the fever still
lurking in his veins,” and so indulged his propensity. During
the previous autumn he had experienced his father’s resentment
for his encouragement of theatricals and constant talk about
Paoli. In reference to his father’s displeasure he thus communicated
with Mr. Temple in September, 1767:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“How unaccountable is it that my father and I should be so ill
together! He is a man of sense and a man of worth; but from
some unhappy turn in his disposition he is much dissatisfied
with a son whom you know. I write to him with warmth, with
an honest pride, wishing that he should think of me as I am;
but my letters shock him, and every expression in them is
interpreted unfavourably. To give you an instance, I send you
a letter I had from him a few days ago. How galling is it
to the friend of Paoli to be treated so! I have answered him in
my own style. I will be myself.... Temple, would you not
like such a son? would you not feel a glow of parental joy? I
know you would; and yet my worthy father writes to me in the
manner you see, with that Scots strength of sarcasm which is
peculiar to a North Briton. But he is offended with that fire
which you and I cherish as the essence of our souls; and how can
I make him happy? Am I bound to do so at the expense, not
of this or the other agreeable wish, but at the expense of myself?
The time was when such a letter from my father as the one
I enclose would have depressed; but I am now firm, and as my
revered friend Mr. Samuel Johnson used to say, I feel the privileges
of an independent human being. However, it is hard that
I cannot have the pious satisfaction of being well with my
father.”</p>

<p class="p1">To lose the paternal favour was perilous; so Boswell’s next
literary performance was of a professional character. When he
commenced practice as an advocate, society in Edinburgh
and in the country generally was much agitated in connection
with the Douglas case. The question at issue was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whether Mr. Archibald Douglas was the real heir to the
estates of Douglas, the succession otherwise devolving on
the Duke of Hamilton. The Lady Jane Douglas was twice
married. By her first union, which subsisted for many years
she had no children; she married secondly Mr. Stewart, afterwards
Sir John Stewart, Bart., of Grandtully, an aged gentleman
in feeble health, and by this marriage, as was alleged, gave
birth to twin sons in her fifty-first year. Lady Jane long
resided in France; her alleged <i>accouchement</i> took place in the
house of a Madame le Brun, in Paris, and it was asserted that
the children which she claimed as her sons were purchased from a
Parisian rope-dancer. The younger of the two boys died in
childhood, and on the death of the Duke of Douglas his Grace’s
estates were claimed by Archibald, the elder son. The validity
of his claim was disputed, and the evidence adduced on both
sides occupies several quarto volumes. In the Court of Session
the claimant’s birth was pronounced supposititious, on the casting
vote of the Lord President Dundas. On appeal that decision
was reversed by the House of Lords, Lord Camden, the Chancellor,
alleging that “a more ample and positive proof of the
child’s being the son of a mother never appeared in a court of
justice.”</p>

<p>While the Douglas case was exciting its utmost interest,
Boswell became a keen supporter of the claimant, Mr. Archibald
Douglas; and in November, 1767, produced a pamphlet entitled
“The Essence of the Douglas Cause.” This <i>brochure</i> was issued
in reply to a small publication entitled “Considerations on the
Douglas Cause,” but failed to excite any general attention. The
author, however, cherished the belief that he had been of essential
service to Mr. Douglas, and accordingly requested that his
name might be added to the list of counsel retained on his
behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Boswell, we have seen, had begun to think of matrimony. In
that direction his thoughts were sufficiently persistent, though
in respect to the object of affection singularly variable. On the
30th March, 1767, he thus addressed Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“What say you to my marrying? I intend, next autumn, to
visit Miss Bosville in Yorkshire; but I fear, my lot being cast in
Scotland, that beauty would not be content. She is, however,
grave; I shall see. There is a young lady in the neighbourhood
here who has an estate of her own between two and three
hundred a year, just eighteen, a genteel person, an agreeable face,
of a good family, sensible, good-tempered, cheerful, pious. You
know my grand object is the ancient family of Auchinleck&mdash;a
venerable and noble principle. How would it do to conclude an
alliance with the neighbouring princess, and add her lands to
our dominions? I should at once have a very pretty little
estate, a good house, and a sweet place. My father is very fond
of her: it would make him perfectly happy: he gives me hints
in this way:&mdash;‘I wish you had her,’&mdash;‘No bad scheme this; I
think it a very good one.’ But I will not be in a hurry; there
is plenty of time.”</p>

<p class="p1">Writing to Mr. Temple on the 12th June, Boswell omits all
reference to Miss Bosville, but extols “the young lady in his
neighbourhood” as a kind of goddess.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The lady in my neighbourhood,” he writes, “is the finest
woman I have ever seen. I went and visited her, and she was
so good as to prevail with her mother to come to Auchinleck,
where they stayed four days, and in our romantic groves I
adored her like a divinity. I have already given you her character.
My father is very desirous I should marry her; all
my relations, all my neighbours, approve of it. She looked
quite at home in the house of Auchinleck. Her picture would
be an ornament to the gallery. Her children would be all
Boswells and Temples, and as fine women as these are excellent
men. And now my friend, my best adviser, comes to hear me
talk of her and to fix my wavering mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In his next letter to Mr. Temple, Boswell reveals that his
“angelic princess” is “Miss Blair, of Adamtown,” adding that
on the preceding Tuesday he had got inebriated in drinking her
health, and in that condition had committed miserable follies.
He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You must resolve to visit my goddess. You are a stranger,
and may do a romantic thing. You shall have consultation
guineas, as an ambassador has his appointments. You see how
I use you. In short, between us two, all rules and all maxims
are suspended. Pray prepare yourself for this adventure; we
shall settle it, I hope; I cannot go with you, though. You are
to see our country for a jaunt upon my recommendation.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell was practical for once. In assuring his reverend
friend that he would have his “consultation guineas” he meant
that his travelling costs would be defrayed should he consent to
visit Ayrshire, and recommend him to Miss Blair. The proposal
was acceded to. Mr. Temple agreed to proceed on his mission
at once on being furnished with the needful instructions. Before
the end of July he was in Scotland, provided with an itinerary,
from which we extract the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Thomas<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> will bring you to Adamtown a little
after eleven. Send up your name; if possible, put up your
horses there, they can have cut grass; if not, Thomas will take
them to Mountain, a place a mile off, and come back and wait
at dinner. Give Miss Blair my letter. Salute her and her
mother; ask to walk. See the place fully; think what improvements
should be made. Talk of my mare, the purse, the chocolate.
Tell them you are my very old and intimate friend. Praise
me for my good qualities, you know them; but talk also how
odd, how inconstant, how impetuous, how much accustomed to
women of intrigue. Ask gravely, ‘Pray don’t you imagine there
is something of madness in that family?’ Talk of my various
travels, German princes, Voltaire and Rousseau. Talk of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
father, my strong desire to have my own house. Observe her
well. See how amiable! Judge if she would be happy with
your friend. Think of me as the great man at Adamtown&mdash;quite
classical, too! Study the mother. Remember well what
passes. Stay tea. At six order horses and go to New Mills,
two miles from Loudoun; but if they press you stay all night,
do it. Be a man of as much ease as possible. Consider what a
romantic expedition you are on; take notes; perhaps you now
fix me for life.”</p>

<p class="p1">Instructions more extraordinary were never before delivered
by lovesick swain to the friend of his suit. That friend was
to inform the lady of his affections that he was “much accustomed
to women of intrigue;” that he was “odd,” “inconstant,”
and “impetuous;” and he was even to hint that there was
madness in his family. That Boswell should have brought his
friend 500 miles so to describe him to the lady of his affections
is not the least remarkable feature of his strange career.
Mr. Temple, it is hoped, was more discreet than his client.</p>

<p>On his return to Mamhead Mr. Temple married a gentlewoman
who brought him a fortune of £1,300. Boswell wrote
to Miss Blair, thanking her for her attention to his friend, but
the lady was silent. Her suitor became perplexed; he feared
that a certain nabob had “struck in,” or that Temple “had told
her his faults too honestly.” At length, after he had endured
the miseries of “a feverish disorder, the lady relented, and sent
him a most agreeable letter.” She made an excuse that a
letter of his had been delayed at the Ayr post office; but he
had written several. On the 28th August he again communicates
with Mr. Temple. He assumes the designation of
a sovereign prince, and holds the clergyman as his ambassador.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Are you not happy,” he writes, “to find that all is well
between the Prince of Auchinleck and his fair neighbouring
princess? In short, sir, I am one of the most fortunate men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in the world. As Miss Blair is my great object at present,
and you are a principal minister in forwarding the alliance, I
enclose you the latest papers on the subject. You will find
the letter I wrote her when ill, where you will see a Scots
word <i>roving</i>, from the French <i>rêver</i>, as if to dream awake.
I put it down as a good English word, not having looked in
Johnson. You will next find the lady’s answer, then a long
letter from me, which required an extraordinary degree of good
sense and temper to answer it with an agreeable propriety;
then her answer, which exceeds my highest expectations.
Read these papers in their order, and let me have your
excellency’s opinion. Am I not now as well as I can
be? What condescension! what a desire to please! She
studies my disposition, and resolves to be cautious, &amp;c. Adorable
woman! Don’t you think I had better not write again
till I see her? I shall go west in a fortnight, but I can hardly
restrain myself from writing to her in transport. I will go to
Adamtown and stay a week. I will have no disguise; we
shall see each other fairly. We are both independent; we have
no temptation to marry but to make each other happy. Let
us be sure if that would be the consequence.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 5th of November Boswell writes to Mr. Temple
from Adamtown:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">My dear Temple</span>,&mdash;The pleasure of your countenance in
reading the date of this letter is before me at this moment....
In short, I am sitting in the room with my princess, who is at
this moment a finer woman than ever she appeared to me before.
But, my valuable friend, be not too certain of your Boswell’s
felicity, for indeed he has little of it at present.... For ten
days I was in a fever, but at last I broke the enchantment.
However, I could not be too sullen in my pride; I wrote to
her from Auchinleck, and wished her joy, &amp;c.; she answered
me, with the same ease as ever, that I had no occasion. I
then wrote her a strange sultanish letter, very cold and very
formal, and did not go to see her for near three weeks....</p>

<p>“But the princess and I have not yet made up our quarrel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
she talks lightly of it. I am resolved to have a serious conversation
with her to-morrow morning. If she can still remain
indifferent as to what has given me much pain, she is not the
woman I thought her, and from to-morrow morning shall I be
severed from her as a lover. I shall just bring myself, I hope,
to a good easy tranquillity. If she feels as I wish her to do, I
shall adore her while my blood is warm.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">After an interval of three days Boswell again communicated
with Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>Auchinleck, Sunday, 8th November, 1767.</i></p>

<p>“I wrote you from Adamtown, and told you how it was with
the princess and me. Next morning I told her that I had complained
to you that she would not make up our last quarrel,
but she did not appear in the least inclined to own herself in
the wrong. I confess that, between pride and love, I was unable
to speak to her but in a very awkward manner. I came home
on Friday; yesterday I was extremely uneasy. That I might
give her a fair opportunity, I sent her a letter, of which I enclose
you a copy. Could the proud Boswell say more than you will
see there? In the evening I got her answer; it was written
with an art and indifference astonishing from so young a lady:&mdash;‘I
have not yet found out that I was to blame. If you have
been uneasy on my account, I am indeed sorry for it; I should
be sorry to give any person uneasiness, far more one whose
cousin and friend I shall always be.’...</p>

<p>“In short, Temple, she is cunning, and sees my weakness.
But I now see her; and though I cannot but suffer severely, I
from this moment resolve to think no more of her. I send you
the copy of a note which goes to her to-morrow morning. Wish
me joy, my good friend, of having discovered the snake before
too late. I should have been ruined had I made such a woman
my wife. Luckily for me, a neighbour who came to Auchinleck
last night told me that he had heard three people at Ayr agree
in abusing her as a jilt. What a risk have I run! However,
as there is still a possibility that all this may be mistake and
malice, I shall behave to her in a very respectful manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
shall never say a word against her but to you. After this I shall
be upon my guard against ever indulging the least fondness for
a Scotch lass. I am a soul of a more southern frame. I may,
perhaps, be fortunate enough to find an Englishwoman who
will be sensible of my merit, and will study to please my
singular humour.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Subsequent letters from Boswell to Mr. Temple contain these
passages:&mdash;“Upon my soul, the madness of which I have a strong
degree in my composition is at present so heightened by love
that I am absolutely deprived of judgment.... One great
fault of mine is talking at random; I will guard against it.”
Referring to the object of his hopes at Adamtown, he writes:&mdash;“I
will consecrate myself to her for ever. I must have her
to learn the harpsichord and French; she shall be one of the
first women in the island.” “Temple, I ventured to seize her
hand. She is really the finest woman to me I ever saw.”</p>

<p>To Mr. Temple, on the 24th December, he wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In my last I told you that after I had resolved to give up
with the Princess for ever, I resolved first to see her. I was
so lucky as to have a very agreeable interview, and was convinced
by her that she was not to blame. This happened on a
Thursday; that evening her cousin and most intimate friend, the
Duchess of Gordon, came to town. Next day I was at the concert
with them, and afterwards supped at Lord Kames’s. The
Princess appeared distant and reserved. I could hardly believe
that it was the same woman with whom I had been quite gay
the day before; I was then uneasy. Next evening I was at the
play with them: it was ‘Othello.’ I sat close behind the Princess,
and at the most affecting scenes I pressed my hand upon her
waist; she was in tears, and rather leaned to me. The jealous
Moor described my very soul.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell subjoins a dialogue between “the Princess” and himself.
“You are very fond of Auchinleck,” said Boswell in his
pleading. “I confess I am,” responded the lady; “I wish I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
liked you as well as I do Auchinleck.” There had been
repeated meetings and lengthy conversations, but Boswell could
not extract a promise, and knew not what to think. He begs
that Mr. Temple will consult with his wife, and thereupon
advise him. Towards the close of his letter he writes, “Amidst
all this love I have been wild as ever.... To-morrow I
shall be happy with my devotions.... Could you assist
me to keep up my real dignity among the illiterate race of Scots
lawyers?”</p>

<p>To Mr. Temple he writes from Edinburgh on the 8th February,
1768:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“All is over between Miss Blair and me. I have delayed
writing till I could give you some final account. About a fortnight
after she went to the country a report went that she was
going to be married to Sir Alexander Gilmour, Member of
Parliament for Mid-Lothian, a young man about thirty, who
has £1,600 a year of estate, was formerly an officer in the
Guards, and is now one of the clerks of the Board of Green
Cloth, a thousand a year&mdash;in short, a noble match, though a
man of expense, and obliged to lead a London life. After the
fair agreement between her and me, which I gave you in my
last, I had a title to know the truth. I wrote to her seriously,
and told her if she did not write me an answer I should believe
the report to be true. After three days I concluded from her
silence that she was at least engaged. I endeavoured to laugh
off my passion, and I got Sir Alexander Gilmour to frank a letter
to her, which I wrote in a pleasant strain, and amused myself
with the whim; still, however, I was not absolutely certain, as
her conduct has been so prudent all along.”</p>

<p class="p1">To ask a gentleman to frank a letter for him addressed to a
young lady of whom they were rival lovers was an act of eccentricity
befitting Boswell only. In the letter above quoted he
proceeds to inform Mr. Temple that the heiress having come to
town, he began to apprehend that her affections were engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by a Mr. Fullerton, whom he describes as his “old rival, the
nabob.” So he procured the nabob’s acquaintance, and they
called on the heiress together. She received them courteously,
but with greater than wonted reserve. Boswell was determined
to know the worst. He entertained Mr. Fullerton to supper at
the house of a relative, and the same evening took him to a
tavern and warmed him “with old claret.” As anticipated, Mr.
Fullerton became very communicative, admitting that he had
been assiduous in attending Miss Blair, but had received no
suitable encouragement. He and Boswell remained together
long after midnight, and before separating agreed that each on
the morrow should visit the heiress, and make proposals to her.
Boswell made sure to reach first, as he went to breakfast; he
proposed, and was refused. The nabob called on Miss Blair an
hour or two afterwards, and was overpowered with her coldness.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Now that all is over,” Boswell sums up, “I see many faults
in her which I did not see before.... I am, however,
resolved to look out for a good wife either here or in England....
The heiress is a good Scots lass, but I must have an
Englishwoman. You cannot say how fine a woman I may
marry. Perhaps a Howard, or some other of the noblest in the
kingdom.”</p>

<p class="p1">Finally, to assure his correspondent that he was not distracted
by rejection or disappointed hope, he embodied in his
communication the following somewhat splenetic verses at
the expense of the “princess:”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Although I be an honest laird,</p>
<p class="pp7">In person rather strong and brawny,</p>
<p class="pp6">For me the heiress never cared,</p>
<p class="pp7">For she would have the knight Sir Sawney.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And when with ardent vows I swore,</p>
<p class="pp7">Loud as Sir Jonathan Trelawney,</p>
<p class="pp6">The heiress showed me to the door,</p>
<p class="pp7">And said she’d have the knight Sir Sawney.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“She told me, with a scornful look,</p>
<p class="pp7">I was as ugly as a tawny;</p>
<p class="pp6">For she a better fish could hook,</p>
<p class="pp7">The rich and gallant knight Sir Sawney.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his next letter to Mr. Temple, dated London, 24th March,
Boswell expresses his joy that he is rid of Miss Blair, and
informs him that he and “a charming Dutchwoman” have
renewed correspondence. Under the name of Zelide she is frequently
mentioned in his previous letters; he had formed her
acquaintance at Utrecht. Zelide is commended as fair, lively,
sensible, and accomplished; and is so deeply attached to the
writer that he feels he cannot be unhappy with her. By having
translated into French his work on Corsica she has shown a just
appreciation of his literary tastes.</p>

<p>Contrary to his usual habit, Boswell on this occasion consulted
both his father and his friend. Zelide, he said, was “willing
to meet him without any engagement;” but his counsellors
were unwilling that any meeting should be held. Writing to
Mr. Temple on the 16th April he admits that Zelide had faults,
but time, he thinks, may have altered her for the better, as it had
in some measure altered himself. However, he was willing, in
deference to his advisers, to renounce Zelide. In a postscript he
asks Mr. Temple’s opinion of Miss Dick,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> “with whom he dined
agreeably.” He describes her as “fine, healthy, young, and
amiable,” though lacking “a good fortune.” He acknowledges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that he had many wanton passions, “and had lately been wild
as ever.” He is much disappointed that his correspondent, to
whom he had previously offered a visit, had no spare bed: he
will visit him after all, and “they will sit up all night together.”</p>

<p>On the 26th April he informs Mr. Temple that Zelide is not
yet given up. He had received a letter from her, “full of good
sense and tenderness,” and he had asked his father to allow him
to visit her at Utrecht. “How do we know,” he proceeds, “but
she is an inestimable prize? Surely it is worth while to go to
Holland to see a fair conclusion, one way or other, of what has
hovered in my mind for years. I have written to her and told
her all my perplexity; I have put in the plainest light what
conduct I actually require of her, and what my father will
require. I have bid her be my wife at present, and comfort me
with a letter, in which she shall show at once her wisdom, her
spirit, and her regard for me. You shall see it. I tell you,
man, she knows me and values me as you do.” Boswell adds
that he has been suffering from a distemper induced by social
indulgence, and vows that he “shall never again behave in a
manner so unworthy the friend of Paoli.”</p>

<p>Disappointment still ruled. In a letter, dated 14th May,
Boswell informs Mr. Temple that he had received a letter from
Zelide. Most gently had he referred to her “levity and infidel
notions,” and she had proved a “termagant and scorched him.”
He had assured his father that Mademoiselle would not suit
him as a wife; she, however, might be “a good correspondent.”</p>

<p>Unaccepted as a lover, Zelide declined becoming a correspondent;
she was soon forgotten. Mr. Temple was opposed to Miss
Dick, and Boswell, though he disapproved his friend’s opinion,
began to look elsewhere. After two months,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> he writes to Mamhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that he had found another mistress&mdash;a certain Mary Anne,
an Irish beauty. He congratulates himself on having escaped
“the insensible Miss B. and the furious Zelide,” and “rejoices in
the finest creature that ever was formed, <i>la belle Irlandaise</i>.”
“Imagine to yourself, Temple,” he adds, “a young lady just sixteen,
formed like a Grecian nymph, with the sweetest countenance,
full of sensibility, accomplished, with a Dublin education,
always half the year in the north of Ireland, her father a councillor-at-law,
with the estate of £1,000 a year, and above £10,000
in ready money; her mother a sensible, well-bred woman; she
the darling of her parents, and no other child but her sister.”
He adds, “Upon my honour I never was so much in love; I
never was before in a situation to which there was not some
objection, but here every flower is united, and not a thorn to be
found.... What a fortunate fellow am I! What a variety
of adventures in all countries! I was allowed to walk a great
deal with Miss&mdash;&mdash;; I repeated my fervent passion to her
again and again; she was pleased, and I could swear that her
little heart beat. I carved the first letter of her name on a tree;
I cut off a lock of her hair, <i>male pertinax</i>. She promised not to
forget me, nor to marry a lord before March.... This is
the most agreeable passion I ever felt; sixteen, innocence, and
gaiety make me quite a Sicilian swain. Before I left London I
made a vow in St. Paul’s church that I would not allow myself
... for six months. I am hitherto firm to my vow, and
already feel myself a superior being.... In short, Maria
has me without any rival.”</p>

<p>Amidst these vows and assurances of amendment, Boswell
acknowledges that he had during the last two months “employed
a great deal of time in gaming,” and had thereby
wasted his means. Within three months he has forgotten
Mary Anne, is again a visitor at Adamtown, and on his knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
before Miss Blair. That lady is provokingly curt, and Boswell
is assured by her mother that he had made such a joke of his
love for her in every company that she was piqued.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> After
“this relapse of fever” has continued a few weeks he bids a
second adieu to Adamtown, and determines to renew his
addresses to Mary Anne. “Then,” he writes, “came a kind
letter from my amiable aunt Boyd in Ireland, and all the charms
of sweet Mary Anne revived. Since that time I have been quite
constant to her, and as indifferent towards Kate as if I never
had thought of her.... After her behaviour, do I, the
candid, generous Boswell, owe her anything? Am I anyhow
bound by passionate inclinations to which she did not even
answer? Write to me, my dear friend. She will be here soon.
I am quite easy with her. What should I do? By all that’s
enchanting I go to Ireland in March!”</p>

<p>To the letter just quoted Boswell adds two postscripts. In
the first he intimates that he is “a good deal in debt.” In the
second, he remarks, “My present misfortune is occasioned by
drinking. Since my return to Scotland I have fallen a great
deal too much into that habit, which still prevails in Scotland.
Perhaps the coldness of the Scots requires it, but my young
blood is turned to madness by it. This will be a warning to
me, and from henceforth I shall be a perfect man; at least, I
hope so.” Confessions which close the letter strongly proved
that the writer’s aspirations after perfection were altogether
illusory.</p>

<p>In May, 1769, Boswell fulfilled his intention of visiting
Ireland. Through the influence of Mr. Sibthorpe, a landowner
in the county or Down, husband of one of his cousins, he was
introduced into elegant and lettered society. At Dublin he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
dined with Lord Charlemont, and met such literary celebrities as
Dr. Leland, Mr. Flood, Dr. Macbride, and George Falconer, the
friend of Swift and Chesterfield. More conspicuous hospitalities
which attended him at Dublin he deemed worthy of a place in
a reputed organ of fashionable intelligence. At his request the
<i>Public Advertiser</i> informed its readers on the 7th of July that
“James Boswell, Esq., having now visited Ireland, he dined with
his Grace the Duke of Leinster at his seat at Carton: he went
also by special invitation to meet the Lord Lieutenant at his
country seat at Leixlip, to which he was conducted, in one of
his Excellency’s coaches, by Lieut.-Colonel Walshe. He dined
there and stayed all night, and next morning came in the coach
with his Excellency to the Phœnix Park, and was present at a
review of Sir Joseph Yorke’s dragoons. He also dined with the
Right Honourable the Lord Mayor. He is now set out on his
return to Scotland.” In Ireland he remained six weeks, chiefly
occupied in prosecuting his suit. But the “charming Mary Anne”
would only laugh at his protestations. In deepest mortification
he complained to his cousin Margaret Montgomerie, who had
accompanied him to Ireland. She offered her sympathy, and
Boswell in gratitude tendered his hand. It was accepted
cordially. Miss Montgomerie was not rich, but she possessed
largely what her lover entirely lacked&mdash;discretion and common
sense. Her pedigree justified her union with the heir of
Auchinleck. Paternally she was related to the noble house of
Eglinton, and her father, Mr. David Montgomerie, of Lainshaw,
claimed the dormant peerage of Lyle. To Lord Auchinleck
the proposed union gave entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>The solemnization of the marriage was deferred till autumn.
Meanwhile Boswell resolved to pay another visit to the metropolis.
Misfortune had attended Paoli. With the sum of £700,
which he raised by subscription, Boswell, in August, 1768,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
shipped for Corsica a quantity of cannon from the Carron Ironworks.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Whether the artillery reached its destination, and to
what extent it proved useful, has not been related. Unable to
overcome Paoli, the Genoese transferred Corsica to the French,
who accepting the gift, despatched an army under the Marshal de
Vaux to take possession. The inhabitants fought bravely, but
were overwhelmed by numbers. Paoli embarked on the 16th
June, 1769, in an English vessel bound for Leghorn. Crossing
the Continent he repaired to London, where he was hailed with
the honours due to his patriotism. Boswell hastened from Scotland
to offer his respects. Paoli received him warmly.</p>

<p>On the 6th September a national jubilee at Stratford-on-Avon
celebrated the memory of Shakspere. Writing on this subject
to the <i>Scots Magazine</i> of the same month, Boswell, while generally
commending the proceedings, expressed regret that the demonstration
commenced with an oratorio. “I could have wished,”
he wrote, “that prayers had been read, and a short sermon
preached; it would have consecrated our jubilee to begin it
with devotion&mdash;with gratefully adoring the Supreme Father of
all spirits, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift.” In
strange contrast with these devotional sentiments was Boswell’s
own procedure at the jubilee. He took the part of a buffoon, in
supposed tribute to patriotism. Rejoicing in his achievement,
he published an account of his appearance in the <i>London
Magazine</i> for September, accompanied with his portrait. His
narrative proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“One of the most remarkable masks upon this occasion was
James Boswell, Esq., in the dress of an armed Corsican chief.
He entered the amphitheatre about twelve o’clock. He wore a
short dark-coloured coat of coarse cloth, scarlet waistcoat and
breeches, and black spatter-dashes; his cap or bonnet was of
black cloth; on the front of it was embroidered in gold letters,
“<i>Viva la Liberta</i>,” and on one side of it was a handsome blue
feather and cockade, so that it had an elegant as well as a warlike
appearance. On the breast of his coat was sewed a Moor’s
head, the crest of Corsica, surrounded with branches of laurel.
He had also a cartridge pouch into which was stuck a stiletto,
and on his left side a pistol was hung upon the belt of his
cartridge pouch. He had a fusee slung across his shoulder,
wore no powder in his hair, but had it plaited at full length
with a knot of blue ribbons at the end of it. He had, by way
of staff, a very curious vine all of one piece, with a bird finely
carved upon it emblematical of the sweet bard of Avon. He
wore no mask, saying that it was not proper for a gallant
Corsican. So soon as he came into the room he drew universal
attention. The novelty of the Corsican dress, its becoming
appearance, and the character of that brave nation concurred to
distinguish the armed Corsican chief. He was first accosted by
Mrs. Garrick, with whom he had a good deal of conversation.
Mr. Boswell danced both a minuet and a country dance with a
very pretty Irish lady, Mrs. Sheldon, wife to Captain Sheldon, of
the 38th Regiment of Foot, who was dressed in a genteel
domino, and before she danced threw off her mask.”</p>

<p class="p1">In honour of Corsica, Boswell read to the assemblage at
Stratford a poem which he published the same month in the
<i>Scots Magazine</i>. These are the concluding lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp7 p1">“Let me plead for liberty distressed,</p>
<p class="pp6">And warm for her each sympathetic breast;<br />
Amidst the splendid honours which you bear,<br />
To save a sister island be your care;<br />
With generous ardour make us also free,<br />
And give to Corsica a noble jubilee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return from Stratford, Dr. Johnson, in a letter dated
9th September, congratulated him on his approaching marriage.
He wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am glad that you are going to be married, and as I wish
you well in things of less importance, wish you well with proportionate
ardour in this crisis of your life. What I can contribute
to your happiness I should be very unwilling to withhold,
for I have always loved and valued you, and shall love you
and value you still more as you become more regular and useful,
effects which a happy marriage will hardly fail to produce.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell was married to Miss Margaret Montgomerie, at
Lainshaw, in Ayrshire, on the 25th November, 1769. On the
same day his father entered on matrimony a second time, by
espousing his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Boswell of
Balmuto, and sister of Claude James Boswell, advocate, afterwards
Lord Balmuto. This event, which Boswell did not
anticipate, considerably modified his nuptial rejoicings. Boswell
was afterwards reconciled; his father’s wife proved kindly and
generous, and she did not, by “multiplying,” add to the family
burdens.</p>

<p>In congratulating Boswell on his new condition Mr. Temple
could not refer rejoicingly to his own matrimonial experiences.
Mrs. Temple had not proved agreeable to her husband or pleasing
to her neighbours. The occupancy of separate apartments did
not rescue Mr. Temple from domestic disquietude, and he became
desirous of abandoning his living of £80 a year for the humble
station of a colonial chaplain.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In the hope of obtaining such
an appointment by the influence of friends in the north, he
proposed a visit to Boswell in the summer of 1770. Boswell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
adduced certain family prospects as a reason why the visit
should be postponed.</p>

<p>About the end of August Mrs. Boswell gave birth to a son,
who, much to the grief of both parents, survived only a few
hours. Boswell sought comfort from his friend Mr. Temple, and
expressed a hope that the visit he had announced he would
fulfil soon. In a letter to Mr. Temple, dated 6th September,
he wrote,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Send your portmanteau on Monday, directed for me at my
house in Chessel’s Buildings, Canongate, and ride you over whenever
you please. Give me all the time you can. My wife will
be in her drawing-room next week, if it pleases God to continue
to favour her. My dear friend, how happy will it make me to
have you under my roof, and enjoy with you some invaluable
hours of elegant friendship and classical sociality!”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Temple remained at Chessel’s Buildings several days.
Though a persistent water-drinker, his visit was much enjoyed
by his host. To a letter afterwards received from him Boswell
replied thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>Edinburgh, 6th October, 1770.</i></p>

<p>“I rejoice that you got so well to Gainslaw. I was afraid
you might find the journey very fatiguing; but you water-drinkers
are Herculean fellows. I believe it would be better
for me were I to adopt your system; but this is only <i>en passant</i>.
It is a bill which would meet with a good deal of opposition in
my lower house. How agreeable is it to me to find that my old
and most intimate friend was so happy in my house! We must
really contrive it so as to pass a good part of our time together.
I never will rest till you have a living in the north, I hope in
Northumberland or Cumberland.</p>

<p>“You cannot say too much to me of my wife. How dare you
quote to me <i>sua si bona norint</i>? I am fully sensible of my happiness
in being married to so excellent a woman, so sensible a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
mistress of a family, so agreeable a companion, so affectionate
and peculiarly proper helpmate for me. I own I am not so much
on my guard against fits of passion or gloom as I ought to be;
but that is really owing to her great goodness. There is something
childish in it, I confess. I ought not to indulge in such fits;
it is like a child that lets itself fall purposely, to have the pleasure
of being tenderly raised up again by those who are fond of it. I
shall endeavour to be better. Upon the whole I do believe I
shall make her happy. God bless and preserve her!”</p></div>

<p class="p1">For eighteen months subsequent to his marriage Boswell
applied himself with unwonted steadiness to literary study, and
the systematic practice of his profession. If he corresponded
regularly with Mr. Temple during this period few of his letters
have been preserved, and he has recorded in his Life of Johnson
that he and the lexicographer resumed, in June, 1771, a correspondence
which had for a year and a half been intermitted. To
a letter from Boswell, soliciting a renewal of epistolary intercourse,
Dr. Johnson wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">
“<i>London, June 20th, 1771.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“I never was so much pleased as now with your account of
yourself; and sincerely hope that, between public business,
improving studies, and domestic pleasures, neither melancholy
nor caprice will find any place for entrance. Whatever philosophy
may determine of material nature, it is certainly true of
intellectual nature that it abhors a vacuum. Our minds cannot
be empty, and evil will break in upon them if they are not preoccupied
by good. My dear sir, mind your studies, mind your
business, make your lady happy, and be a good Christian. After
this,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">‘Tristitiam et metus,</p>
<p class="pp6">Trades protervis in mare Creticum</p>
<p class="pp7">Portare ventis.’</p>

<p class="p1">“If we perform our duty we shall be safe and steady, ‘<i>sive per</i>,’
&amp;c., whether we climb the Highlands or are tost among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Hebrides; and I hope the time will come when we may try our
powers both with cliffs and water.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Dr. Johnson’s letter contains the first published reference to
the proposed journey to the Hebrides. In March, 1772, Boswell
revisited London. He was retained as counsel in a case
appealed to the House of Lords by one Hastie, a schoolmaster,
who had been deprived of office for the cruel treatment of his
pupils. That he might on this occasion properly acquit himself,
he sought and obtained the aid of Dr. Johnson. During his
visit he met Johnson frequently, and, with the intention of
becoming his biographer, carefully recorded his conversations.
He returned to Edinburgh in May.</p>

<p>Revisiting London in the spring of 1773, Boswell was for the
first time invited to dinner at Dr. Johnson’s private residence.
He was, on Dr. Johnson’s motion, admitted a member of the
Literary Club. He had become known to Sir Joshua Reynolds,
Dr. Goldsmith, and Mr. Garrick; he occasionally dined with
General Oglethorpe, and continued on friendly terms with Paoli.
He was a favourite with Mr. Thrale, and frequently enjoyed his
hospitality. He returned to Edinburgh in May, and soon afterwards
Mrs. Boswell presented him with a daughter. He named
the child Veronica, in honour of his great-grandmother, the
Countess of Kincardine, a descendant of the Dutch family of
Somnelsdyck.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson had talked of the proposed Hebridean journey
more definitely. That his purpose might not waver, Boswell
entreated some leading Scotsmen to send him letters of invitation
and encouragement. Among those who responded by offers
of hospitality were the chiefs Macdonald and Macleod, Principal
Robertson, and Dr. Beattie. Johnson was much gratified, and
fully determined to proceed to Scotland before the close of the
summer. He left London early in August, in a post-chaise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
along with Mr. Justice afterwards Sir Robert Chambers. The
latter tarried at Newcastle, and Johnson was accompanied
from thence to Edinburgh by Mr. Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell.
From Newcastle he wrote to Boswell, on Wednesday, the 11th
August, that he hoped to reach Edinburgh on the following
Saturday. On the evening of that day he arrived at Boyd’s
Inn, Canongate, better known as the “White Horse.” A note
announcing his arrival brought Boswell at once. They embraced
cordially, and Boswell led him up High Street to his house in
James’s Court.</p>

<p>To that house Boswell had removed lately from Chessel’s
Buildings. James’s Court was entered from the Lawn Market
by a low gateway. The court was quadrilateral, and opposite the
entrance were two common stairs. Boswell occupied the dwelling
reached by the western staircase, at the height of three
storeys, his door being that at the top of the landing. The
house was formerly occupied by David Hume, who here composed
a portion of his history, and entertained Boswell when a
youth. Dr. Hugh Blair had also occupied the dwelling.</p>

<p>Boswell having notified the arrival, his distinguished guest
was, while he remained in Edinburgh, fêted at every meal.
Among those invited by Boswell to meet him were such
titled persons as the Duchess of Douglas, Lord Chief Baron
Orde, Lord Hailes, Sir William Forbes, Bart., of Pitsligo, Sir
Adolphus Oughton, and Sir Alexander Dick, Bart., of Prestonfield.
Of those known in literature similarly privileged were
Dr. William Robertson, Dr. Blair, Professor Adam Fergusson,
Dr. Gregory, Dr. Alexander Webster, and Dr. Blacklock. It was an
epoch in Boswell’s life, and he was proportionately elated. In
his “Tour,” published fifteen years afterwards, he in reference
to this period of his history presents of himself the following
portraiture:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“Think,” he writes, “of a gentleman of ancient blood, the
pride of which was his predominant passion. He was then in his
thirty-third year, and had been about four years happily married.
His inclination was to be a soldier, but his father, a respectable
judge, had pressed him into the profession of the law. He had
travelled a good deal and seen many varieties of human life;
he had thought more than anybody had supposed, and had a
pretty good stock of general learning and knowledge; he had all
Dr. Johnson’s principles, with some degree of relaxation; he
had rather too little than too much prudence, and his imagination
being lively, he often said things of which the effect was very
different from the intention. He resembled sometimes&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">‘The best good man with the worst-natured muse.’”</p>

<p class="p1">He cannot deny himself the vanity of finishing with the encomium
of Dr. Johnson, whose friendly partiality to the friend of
his tour represents him as one “whose acuteness would help
my inquiry, and whose gaiety of conversation and civility of
manners are sufficient to counteract the inconveniences of travel
in countries less hospitable than we have passed.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">It was arranged that Boswell should accompany the lexicographer
throughout the northern journey; and he made offer
to attend to all business concerns, including those of finance.
The travellers left Edinburgh on Wednesday, the 18th August.
They crossed the Forth at Kinghorn, and proceeded to St. Andrews
by post-chaise. By the professors of that ancient university
they were cordially received and entertained with profuse hospitality.
Among the ruins of the once magnificent cathedral
Dr. Johnson inveighed against the ill-directed zeal of Presbyterian
reformers. The travellers having rested two days at St. Andrews,
proceeded northward by Dundee and Arbroath. When they
reached Montrose, Boswell communicated with Lord Monboddo,
who sent them a cordial invitation to his country seat. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
dined with his lordship, and from thence posted to Aberdeen.
There Dr. Johnson gratified his tastes by engaging in literary
gladiatorship with several of the professors.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 30th August, the travellers inspected a remarkable
rock basin, known as the Buller of Buchan, and dined
at Slains Castle with the Countess of Errol. Next day they
proceeded to Banff, and on that following to Elgin, when they
visited the ruins of the cathedral. On Friday, the 29th, they
reached Nairn, and from thence inspected Cawdor Castle. By
the Rev. Arlay Macaulay, minister of Cawdor, they were kindly
entertained; he was known to them as author of a history of
St. Kilda, and he has further claim to remembrance as member
of a family which produced the celebrated Lord Macaulay. To
his guests he presented a useful itinerary.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 30th August, the travellers inspected Fort
George, and dined with the governor, Sir Eyre Coote. Next
day, at Inverness, they attended the Episcopal Chapel, when
Boswell mentions as an odd coincidence, as to what might be
said of his connecting himself with Dr. Johnson, that Mr. Tait,
the clergyman, remarked in his discourse “that some connected
themselves with men of distinguished talents, and since they
could not equal them, tried to deck themselves with their merit
by being their companions.” The coincidence, puzzling to
Boswell, admitted of simple solution, for Mr. Collector Keith, of
the Excise, a native of Ayrshire, had met the travellers at Fort
George, and to the clergyman notified their approach. Mr.
Tait’s allusion, apart from its truthfulness, was in the worst
taste, and not to be justified. Boswell and Dr. Johnson dined
with Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>At Inverness the travellers hired horses and procured guides.
They remained one night at Fort Augustus, entertained by the
governor, and thence pursued their journey to the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
shores of Skye. Inconvenienced by rough roads, Dr. Johnson
became irritable. As they approached Glenelg, Boswell, without
apprising his companion, rode forward to secure at the inn the
necessary accommodations. Johnson called him back with an
angry shout, and on his return reproved him lustily. Boswell
felt hurt, but did not venture to recriminate. His reflections on
this occasion are thus recorded in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I wished to get on to see how we were to be lodged, and
how we were to get a boat; all of which I thought I could best
settle myself, without his having any trouble. To apply his
great mind to minute particulars is wrong; it is like taking an
immense balance (such as is kept on quays for weighing cargoes
of ships) to weigh a guinea. I knew I had neat little scales
which would do better, and that his attention to everything
which falls in his way, and his uncommon desire to be always
in the right, would make him weigh, if he knew of the particulars;
it was right, therefore, for me to weigh them, and let him
have them only in effect. I, however, continued to ride by him,
finding he wished I should do so.”</p>

<p class="p1">The travellers found the inn at Glenelg nearly destitute of
provisions, but Macleod’s factor sent them rum and sugar, and
at night they rested on beds of hay. Next morning they sailed for
Skye, and landing at Armidale, were met by Sir Alexander Macdonald
and his lady, formerly Miss Bosville, of Yorkshire, with
whom they remained several days. They received much generous
hospitality from Mr. Mackinnon, a farmer who had entertained
Pennant, and were pleased to find that he possessed a considerable
library. Invited to Rasay by the insular Chief, they had
at his house a distinguished reception. After spending some
days at Rasay they returned to Skye, and were conducted to
the residence of Mr. Macdonald, of Kingsburgh. His wife had
earned a reputation which secured her a visit from every
traveller penetrating into the Hebrides. She was the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Flora Macdonald, who under circumstances of peril enabled
Prince Charles Edward to elude the vigilance of his pursuers.
At Kingsburgh Dr. Johnson slept in the bed on which the
Prince rested twenty-seven years before. To her guests Mrs.
Macdonald related the circumstances of the Prince’s escape.</p>

<p>The travellers were conducted to Dunvegan Castle, where
they were entertained by the Laird of Macleod and his accomplished
mother, Lady Macleod. At Dunvegan, Boswell attempting
wit at Dr. Johnson’s expense, paid dearly for his
rashness. Johnson retaliated, sarcastically presenting his assailant
under a variety of degrading images, so as to render him the
sport of the company.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>For two weeks the travellers were attended by Mr. Donald
McQueen, a clergyman in Skye, whose respectable scholarship
gratified Dr. Johnson, while his personal influence availed in
opening channels of hospitality. With Mr. McQueen they parted
on Saturday, the 25th September. On the evening of that
day, Dr. Johnson having retired at an early hour, Boswell sat up
drinking till five o’clock, when, much intoxicated, he was helped
to bed. In the afternoon Johnson entered his apartment,
and denounced him as “a drunken dog.” The words were
uttered playfully, and the inebriate, who had begun to dread a
more terrible reproof, was pleased to find his companion in good
humour. He rose, and opened the Church of England Prayer-book,
and in the Epistle for the day read these words,&mdash;“And
be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.” “Some,” he wrote,
“would have taken this as a divine interposition.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 3rd October, the travellers left Skye for the
island of Col. When they had got to sea a tempest arose; Dr.
Johnson went into the hold and lay down, overcome with sickness.
Conscious of danger, Boswell became meditative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Piety,” he writes, “afforded me comfort; yet I was disturbed
by the objections that have been made against a particular
Providence, and by the arguments of those who maintain that
it is in vain to hope that the petitions of an individual, or even
of congregations, can have any influence with the Deity; objections
which have been often made, and which Dr. Hawkesworth
has lately revived in his preface to the ‘Voyages to the South
Seas;’ but Dr. Ogden’s excellent doctrines on the efficacy of
intercession prevailed.”</p>

<p class="p1">At Col the travellers enjoyed the hospitality of Donald
Maclean, the young <i>laird</i> who some time previously was a companion
of their journey. Owing to unfavourable winds they
remained at Col till Wednesday, the 13th October, when they
sailed for Tobermory, in Mull. From thence they proceeded to
Ulva and Inchkenneth, enjoying on both islands the hospitality
of the owners, Mr. M’Quane and Sir Allan Maclean. Sir Allan
accompanied them in their voyage round Mull to the island of
Iona. They reached the island at nightfall, and procured beds
in a barn among hay. Boswell records that he was much impressed
with the solemnity of the scene; while Sir Allan and
Dr. Johnson were at breakfast he quietly left his companions
and returned to the cathedral. In these words he records his
reflections:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“While contemplating the venerable ruins I reflected with
much satisfaction that the solemn scenes of piety never lose
their sanctity and influence, though the cares and follies of life
may prevent us from visiting them, or may even make us fancy
that their effects are only as yesterday when it is past, and
never again to be perceived. I hoped that ever after having
been in this holy place I should maintain an exemplary conduct.
One has a strong propensity to fix upon some point of time from
whence a better course of life may begin.”</p>

<p class="p1">Accompanied by Sir Allan Maclean the travellers returned to
Mull. After enjoying a series of hospitalities they sailed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Oban, on the mainland. Next day they posted to Inverary.
Boswell reported their arrival to the Duke of Argyll, who cordially
invited them to dinner. To Dr. Johnson the Duke and
Duchess were extremely courteous, but Boswell’s presence was
by the Duchess studiously ignored. As widow of the late Duke
of Hamilton she directed her displeasure at Boswell’s zeal on
behalf of Mr. Archibald Douglas in claiming the Douglas estates,
which she believed to belong lawfully to her former husband.
Boswell took her Grace’s displeasure as a compliment to his
talents, and has in his “Journey” playfully remarked that, his
“punishment being indicted by so dignified a beauty,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> he had
the consolation which a man would feel who is strangled by a
silken cord.”</p>

<p>Arriving on the shores of Lochlomond, the travellers visited
Sir James Colquhoun, Bart., at Rossdhu, and Mr. Commissary
Smollett, cousin of Dr. Tobias Smollett. They posted for Glasgow,
inspecting <i>en route</i> the ancient castle of Dumbarton. At Glasgow
they visited the university, and two of the professors dined
with them at their inn. Proceeding to Ayrshire, they dined with
the Earl of Loudoun, and visited the aged Countess of Eglinton.</p>

<p>During the journey Boswell received a letter from his father,
permitting him to bring his friend to Auchinleck. They arrived
there on Sunday, the 2nd November, and remained a week.
Lord Auchinleck and Dr. Johnson contended keenly on various
points, but the social current moved more smoothly than
Boswell had anticipated. Lord Auchinleck regarded Dr. Johnson’s
politics with aversion, and had denounced him as a
“Jacobite.” Illustrative of his dislike, an anecdote has been
preserved by Sir Walter Scott. When Boswell left Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
with Johnson on their northern tour, Lord Auchinleck remarked
to a friend, “There’s nae hope for Jamie, man; Jamie’s gane
clean gyte. What do you think, man? He’s aff wi’ the landlouping
scoundrel of a Corsican. And whase tail do ye think
he has pinned himself to now, man? a <i>dominie</i>, man,&mdash;an auld
dominie, that keepit a schule and ca’d it an academy.” Boswell
has denied the truth of a report which had gained credit, that
on his representing the lexicographer to his father as a <i>constellation
of genius</i>, he replied, “<i>Ursa Major</i>.” Lord Auchinleck, he
admits, did use the expression, but it was spoken aside to a
brother judge as Dr. Johnson was standing in the Court of
Session.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>After an absence of eighty-three days the travellers returned
to Edinburgh. They were complimented and entertained by
Lord Elibank, Lady Colville, Lord Hailes, Principal Robertson,
and others. Mrs. Boswell, though she did not oppose her
husband taking part in the Hebridean journey, was not reconciled
to it. On his return she remarked to him, “I have seen a
bear led by a man, but I never before saw a man led by a bear.”
Boswell accepted the remark facetiously, and, in the belief he
would enjoy it, repeated it to Dr. Johnson. As might have been
expected, the lexicographer felt most keenly the allusion to his
rough manners, and he was placed in circumstances in which retort
was impossible. Removal was his only refuge, and he hastened
his departure. He left Edinburgh in the stage-coach on the 22nd
November&mdash;just twelve days after his return to the city. But
he did not forget Mrs. Boswell’s censure. For several years he
alluded to her disliking him in many letters to her husband.
Writing to Boswell on the 29th January, 1774, he sends his
compliments to Mrs. Boswell, adding, “Tell her I do not love
her the less for wishing me away.” On the 5th March he wrote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
“Mrs. Boswell is a sweet lady&mdash;only she was so glad to see
me go that I have almost a mind to come again, that she may
again have the same pleasure.” In the same strain he writes
to Boswell on the 27th August, 1775,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Of Mrs. Boswell, though she knows in her heart that she
does not love me, I am always glad to hear any good, and hope
that she and the dear little ladies will have neither sickness nor
any other affliction. But she knows that she does not care
what becomes of me, and for that she may be sure that I think
her very much to blame.”</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. Johnson prepared his “Journey to the Hebrides” most
leisurely; it was not published till January, 1775. Boswell
received a parcel of copies, one for himself, others for persons
who had shown particular attention to the writer. In distributing
the volumes he invited special attention to an encomium
upon himself in the earlier portion of the work. Obtaining
charge of several cases appealed from the Court of Session to
the House of Lords, he hastened to London to enjoy the honours
which he conceived Dr. Johnson’s eulogy must have secured him.</p>

<p>On the evening of Saturday, the 18th March, Boswell by the
Edinburgh diligence reached Grantham. Travelling being suspended
till Monday, he in the interval wrote a long letter to
Mr. Temple. An extract follows.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I am now,” he proceeded, “so far on my way to London in the
fly. It is Saturday night, and we repose here all Sunday. I have
an acquaintance in Grantham, the Rev. Mr. Palmer, who was
chaplain to the late Speaker; he is a worthy, learned, social man.
I sent him a card that I would breakfast with him to-morrow,
if not inconvenient to him. His answer is just come, which you
shall hear: As breakfasting will be attended with some inconveniences
in the present state of his family, he will be very glad of the
favour of his company to a family dinner to-morrow at two o’clock.
What can be the meaning of this? <i>How can breakfasting be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
inconvenient to a family that dines?</i> Can he wish to lie long in
the morning that Queen Mab may be with him, ‘tickling the
parson as he lies asleep’? or can his wife and daughter not
dress early enough? Pray guess in your next, with a sacerdotal
sagacity, what this can be. I shall try to learn and let you
know. It is now early in the morning. I am writing in a
great English parlour, to have my letter ready for the post at
nine. It is comfortable to have such an acquaintance as
Palmer&mdash;so situated. I have thought of making a good acquaintance
in each town on the road. No man has been more
successful in making acquaintance easily than I have been. I
even bring people quickly on to a degree of cordiality. I am a
quick fire, but I know not if I last sufficiently, though surely,
my dear Temple, there is always a warm place for you. With
many people I have compared myself to a taper, which can
light up a great and lasting fire, though itself is soon extinguished....</p>

<p>“Mr. Johnson, when enumerating our club, observed of some
of us that they talked from books,&mdash;Langton in particular.
Garrick, he said, would talk from books, if he talked seriously.
‘I,’ said he, ‘do not talk from books; you do not talk from
books.’ This was a compliment to my originality, but I am
afraid I have not read books enough to be able to talk from
them. You are very kind in saying that I may overtake you in
learning. Believe me, though, that I have a kind of impotency
of study; however, <i>nil desperandum est</i>....</p>

<p>“For my own part, I have continued schemes of publication,
but cannot fix. I am still very unhappy with my father. We
are so totally different that a good understanding is scarcely
possible. He looks on my going to London just now as an
<i>expedition</i>, as idle and extravagant, when in reality it is highly
improving to me, considering the company which I enjoy; and
I think it is also for my interest, as in time I may get something.
Lord Pembroke was very obliging to me when he was
in Scotland, and has corresponded with me since. I have hopes
from him. How happy should I be to get an independency by
my own influence while my father is alive!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am in charming health and spirits. There is a handsome
maid in this inn, who interrupts me by coming sometimes into
the room&mdash;I have no confession to make, my priest, so be not
curious.</p>

<p class="pc ls2">******</p>

<p>“Dr. Young says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc p1">‘A fever argues better than a Clarke.’</p>

<p class="p1">It is as fair reasoning for me to say that this handsome maid
(Matty is her name) argues better than&mdash;whom you please.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Boswell reached London on the 21st March, and at once
waited on Dr. Johnson, who received him cordially. On the
4th April he despatched a long letter to Mr. Temple, of which
a portion is subjoined:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">My dear Temple</span>,</p>

<p class="pi4a">“My last was indeed a characteristical letter: I was quite in
my old humour. My mind, formerly a wild, has been for some
years pretty well enclosed with moral fences; but I fear the
fences are stone hedges (to use a strange expression of Mr.
Johnson in his ‘Journey’) of a loose construction, for a storm of
passion would blow them down. When at Grantham there
was a pretty brisk gale, which shook them; but now Reason,
that steady builder and overseer, has set them firm, or they have
proved to be better than I thought them, for my enclosures are
in as good order as ever. I thank you, however, for your
friendly props; your kind counsels pleased me much.</p>

<p class="pc ls2">******</p>

<p>“Your soft admonitions would at any time calm the tempests
of my soul. I told you that my arguments for concubinage were
only for theory; the patriarchs might have a plurality, because
they were not taught that it was wrong; but I, who have always
been taught that it is wrong, cannot have the same enjoyment
without an impression of its being so, and consequently without
my moral sense suffering. But is not this prejudice? Be
it so....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had last night an unexpected call to be at the bar of the
House of Commons this day for Captain Erskine, brother to Miss
Floyer’s husband, as counsel for him in the Clackmannan election,
where he is petitioner. I had neither wig nor gown with
me. I posted to Claxton’s early this morning, and he has kindly
lent me both. I know not but in equity he should have a share
of the guineas which they bring....</p>

<p>“To-day I dine at Sir John Pringle’s; to-morrow at Dilly’s,
with Mr. Johnson and Langton, &amp;c.; Thursday at Tom Davies’s,
with Mr. Johnson and some others; Friday at the Turk’s Head,
Gerrard Street, with our club, Sir Joshua Reynolds, &amp;c., who
now dine once a month, and sup every Friday. My forenoons
are spent in visiting, and you know the distances of London
make that business enough. Mr. Johnson has allowed me to
write out a supplement to his Journey, but I wish I may be able
to settle to it. This House of Commons work will be good
ballast for me. I am little in what is called the gaiety of
London; I went to Mrs. Abingdon’s benefit to please Sir Joshua
Reynolds. I have been at no other public place except exhibitions
of pictures with Lord Mountstuart;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> he is warmly my
friend, and has engaged to do for me. His brother’s lady,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a
sweet, handsome, lively little woman, is my wife’s intimate
friend. I pass many of my morning hours with her. Paoli and
I (for his simple designation is the highest) are to be at Wilton
some time between the 10th and 26th of this month; I shall go
from thence to your parsonage and overpower you with vivacity,
and return to Bath.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Boswell proceeded to Mamhead, and there, though his host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
was an abstainer, got very drunk. Mr. Temple entreated him,
when he became sober, to abandon his intemperate habits.
As they talked together under an aged yew, Boswell vowed that
he should henceforth avoid excess and cherish moderation.
In a letter to Mr. Temple, dated the 10th May, he remarked
that Dr. Johnson was now discouraging his proposal to add
a supplement to his “Journey.” This proceeding he attributes
to Dr. Johnson’s unwillingness that any one should share his
laurels. “But don’t you think,” he adds, “I may write out my
remarks on Scotland, and send them to be revised by you?
and then they may be published freely. Give me your opinion
of this.”</p>

<p>Good Friday, which fell upon the 14th of April, Boswell
spent with Dr. Johnson. They were present at three religious
services, and in the evening they sat “a long while together in a
serene, undisturbed frame of mind.” On Easter Sunday Boswell
“attended the solemn service at St. Paul’s.” Writing next day
to Mr. Temple, he informs him that he had “received the holy
sacrament, and was exalted in piety.” In the same letter he
reports that he is enjoying “the metropolis to the full,” and that
he has had “too much dissipation.” He asks his friend not to
fear “his Asiatic multiplicity,” except when he happens to
“take too much claret.”</p>

<p>Boswell remained in London about two months, and though
chiefly engaged in driving out, contrived to pocket forty guineas
of professional fees. From Grantham, <i>en route</i> for Scotland, he
wrote to Mr. Temple that, much to his disgust, “Henry Dundas,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
a coarse, unlettered, unfanciful dog,” was to be made Lord
Advocate “at thirty-three,” and that he had personally resolved
to join the English Bar on obtaining his father’s consent. He
proceeds,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I passed a delightful day yesterday. After breakfasting
with Paoli and worshipping at St. Paul’s, I dined <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
my charming Mrs. Stuart, of whom you have read in my Journal.
She refused to be of a party at Richmond, that she and I might
enjoy a farewell interview. We dined in all the elegance of two
courses and a dessert, with dumb waiters, except when the
second course and the dessert were served. We talked with unreserved
freedom, as we had nothing to fear; we were <i>philosophical</i>,
upon honour&mdash;not deep, but feeling we were pious;
we drank tea, and bid each other adieu as purely as romance
paints. She is my wife’s dearest friend, so you see how beautiful
our intimacy is.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell adds that “the handsome chambermaid had gone
from the inn,” and that he had promised Dr. Johnson to accept
a chest of books of the moralist’s own selection, and to “read
more and drink less.” He sums up, “Tell Mrs. Temple that I
am a favourite with her, because she knows me better, and that
she may be assured that the more she knows me the more
allowance will she make for my faults.” A postscript is added.
“There is,” he writes, “a Miss Silverton in the fly with me,
an amiable creature, who has been in France. I can unite little
fondnesses with perfect conjugal love. Remember to put my
letters in a book neatly,&mdash;see which of us does it first.”</p>

<p>From Edinburgh, on the 3rd June, Boswell wrote to Mr.
Temple as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On my arrival here I had the pleasure to find my wife
and two little daughters as well as I could wish; but indeed,
my worthy friend, it required some philosophy to bear the
change from England to Scotland. The unpleasing tone, the
rude familiarity, the barren conversation, of those whom I found
here, in comparison with what I had left, really hurt my feelings....
The General Assembly is sitting, and I practise at its
bar. There is <i>de facto</i> something low and coarse in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
employment, though on paper it is a Court of <i>Supreme Judicature</i>;
but guineas must be had.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Low and coarse” as Boswell regarded the practice of his profession
in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, he
acknowledges that he did not perform his part without some
misgiving. “Do you know,” he proceeds, “it requires more
than ordinary spirit to do what I am to do this very morning; I
am to go to the General Assembly and arraign a judgment
pronounced last year by Dr. Robertson, John Home, and a good
many more of them, and they are to appear on the other side.
To speak well, when I despise both the cause and the judges,
is difficult; but I believe I shall do so wonderfully. I look
forward with aversion to the little dull labours of the Court of
Session.”</p>

<p>Besides being disgusted with the Scottish Lord Advocate,
Scottish manners, and Scottish courts, ecclesiastical and civil,
Boswell was particularly dissatisfied with his father. He had
sent him, he writes, “a conciliatory letter, but he fears he is
callous.” In dread of the paternal allowance being discontinued,
he writes,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“If Lord Mountstuart would but give me an independency
from the King while my father lives, I should be a fine fellow.”
He adds, “My promise under the venerable yew has kept me
sober.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell’s habits were not more pleasing to his father than
were his professional diligence and domestic economy. In
the belief that his son was an incorrigible idler, Lord Auchinleck
seriously meditated a withdrawal of his pension. But
for his two children, disinheritance might have followed. To
Mr. Temple on the 19th of June he wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My father is most unhappily dissatisfied with me. My wife
and I dined with him on Saturday; he did not salute her, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
he had not seen her for three months; nor did he so much as
ask her how she did, though she is advanced in pregnancy. I
understand he fancies that if I had married another woman, I
might not only have had a better portion with her, but might
have been kept from what he thinks idle and extravagant conduct.
He harps on my going over Scotland with a brute<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> (think
how shockingly erroneous!), and wandering, or some such
phrase, to London. In vain do I defend myself; even the circumstance
that my last jaunt to London did not cost me £20&mdash;as
I got forty-two guineas in London&mdash;does not affect him. How
hard it is that I am totally excluded from parental comfort! I
have a mind to go to Auchinleck next autumn, and try what
living in a mixed stupidity of attention to common objects, and
restraint from expressing any of my own feelings, can do with
him. I always dread his making some bad settlement.”</p>

<p class="p1">Lord Auchinleck had solid grounds for indignation. He
allowed his son £300 per annum, besides having provided him
with a very expensive education. In the Scottish courts Boswell
had abundant employment when he evinced the slightest inclination
to attend to it. He had run himself aground; he owed
a thousand pounds, which he could not pay, and his creditors
were clamorous. Fretting under the unexpected burden which
he was expected to sustain, Lord Auchinleck felt disposed to
blame his daughter-in-law for encouraging his son’s extravagance,
and it is not certain that Boswell took the blame solely
upon himself. The worthy judge was at length got over, and
Boswell recovered his elasticity. To Mr. Temple on the 12th
August he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Tell me, my dear Temple, if a man who receives so many
marks of more than ordinary consideration can be satisfied to
drudge in an obscure corner, where the manners of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
are disagreeable to him? You see how soon I revive again.
Could I but persuade my father to give me £400 a year, and let
me go to the English Bar, I think I should be much better.
That, however, seems to be impossible. As he is bound for
£1,000 which I owe, he has resolved to lessen his allowance to
me of £300 to £200. I must not dispute with him, but he is
really a strange man. He is gone to Auchinleck. I intend to
pass a little while with him there soon, and sound him; or
there see just what attention can produce.”</p>

<p class="p1">In allusion to the request that his letters might be preserved,
Boswell was assured by Mr. Temple that he too contemplated
a publication. Boswell pronounces it “a charming thought.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
He refers exultingly to the attention he had lately received from
Paoli. “For the last fortnight that I was in London,” he writes,
“I lay at his house, and had the command of his coach....
I felt more dignity when I had several servants at my devotion,
a large apartment, and the convenience and state of a coach; I
recollected that this dignity in London was honourably acquired
by my travels abroad, and my pen after I came home, so I could
enjoy it with my own approbation; and in the extent and
multiplicity of the metropolis other people had not even the
materials for finding fault, as my situation was not particularly
known.”</p>

<p>Referring to his resolution to read more constantly, Boswell
informs Mr. Temple, on the 19th June, that he has not yet
“begun to read,” but that “his resolution is lively.” Lord
Kames had asked him to become his biographer, a piece of
intelligence which does not again crop up. In a conversation
about Dr. Johnson he had disputed with Mr. Hume. The quarrel
is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Mr. Hume said he would give me half a crown for every
page of his dictionary in which he would not find an absurdity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
if I would give him half a crown for every page in which
he did find one; he talked so insolently, really, that I calmly
determined to be at him; so I repeated, by way of telling
that Dr. Johnson could be touched, the admirable passage in
your letter, how the Ministry had set him to write in a way
that they ‘could not ask even their infidel pensioner Hume to
write.’ Upon honour, I did not give the least hint from whom
I had the letter. When Hume asked if it was from an American,
I said ‘No; it was from an English gentleman.’ ‘Would a
gentleman write so?’ said he. In short, Davy was finely
punished for his treatment of my revered friend; and he deserved
it richly, both for his petulance to so great a character, and for
his talking so before me.”</p>

<p class="p1">In a letter dated 12th August he informed his reverend
correspondent that he had been suffering from his “atrabilious
temperament.” In his melancholy he had been strongly
impressed by the phrase in Scripture, “Seek ye the Lord while
He may be found.” From sleep at night he had awakened
“dreading annihilation or being thrown into some horrible
state of being.” He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My promise under the solemn yew I have observed wonderfully,
having never infringed it till the other day a very jovial
company of us dined at a tavern, and I unwarily exceeded my
bottle of old hock; and having once broke over the pale I run
wild. But I did not get drunk; I was, however, intoxicated,
and very ill next day. I ask your forgiveness, and I shall be
more strictly cautious for the future. The drunken manners of
this country are very bad.”</p>

<p class="p1">The distinction between being <i>intoxicated</i> and <i>drunk</i> is not
very obvious, and the allusion by way of defence to the intemperate
habits of the country is <i>Boswellian</i>. Amidst his general
gloom Boswell experienced comfort in the assurance by Mr.
Temple that he was preparing for the press a portion of their
correspondence. A specimen was transmitted, and Boswell tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
his advice. He insisted that anonymous authorship would
not suit, and suggested that his own name as “James Boswell,
Esq.,” should be displayed upon the title-page. Mr. Temple
subsequently published selections from his own letters under the
title of “Selection of Historical and Political Memoirs.”</p>

<p>About the middle of August Boswell begged Dr. Johnson for
a prescription against melancholy. The moralist replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“For the black fumes which rise in your mind I can prescribe
nothing but that you disperse them by honest business or innocent
pleasure, and by reading, sometimes easy and sometimes
serious. Change of place is useful, and I hope your residence
at Auchinleck will have many good effects.... Never, my dear
sir,” added Dr. Johnson, “do you take it in your head to think
that I do not love you; you may settle yourself in full confidence
both of my love and esteem. I love you as a kind man, I value
you as a worthy man, and hope in time to reverence you as a
man of exemplary piety. I hold you, as Hamlet has it, ‘in my
heart of hearts,’ and therefore it is little to say that I am,
sir, your affectionate, humble servant,</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">“Sam. Johnson.”</span></p></div>

<p class="p1">To check his “atrabilious” complaint Boswell did not have
recourse to reading. He informed Mr. Temple that since his
return from England his reading had been confined to some
small treatises on midwifery. On the 2nd September he communicated
with Mr. Temple from Auchinleck. He had been
there a week, and had experienced an unsupportable distress.
Next day being Sunday, he proposed to worship in the parish
church, and on Monday to join at Edinburgh his “valuable
spouse and dear little children.” To his dissension with his
father he refers in characteristic fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My father, whom I really both respect and affectionate (if
that is a word, for it is a different feeling from that which is expressed
by <i>love</i>, which I can say of you from my soul), is so
different from me. We <i>divaricate</i> so much, as Dr. Johnson said,
that I am often hurt when I dare say he means no harm; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
has a method of treating me which makes me feel myself like a
<i>timid boy</i>, which to <i>Boswell</i> (comprehending all that my character
does in my own imagination and in that of a wonderful number
of mankind) is intolerable. His wife, too, whom in my conscience
I cannot condemn for any capital bad quality, is so narrow-minded,
and, I don’t know how, so set upon keeping him under
her own management, and so suspicious and so sourishly tempered
that it requires the utmost exertion of practical philosophy
to keep myself quiet. I, however, have done so all this week to
admiration; nay, I have appeared good-humoured, but it has
cost me drinking a considerable quantity of strong beer to dull
my faculties....</p>

<p class="pbq">“I have sauntered about with my father, and he has seen that
I am pleased with his works. But what a discouraging reflection
it is that he has in his possession a renunciation of my birthright
which I madly granted him, and which he has not the
generosity to restore now that I am doing beyond his utmost
hopes, and that he may incommode and disgrace me by some
strange settlement, while all this time not a shilling is secured
to my wife and children in case of my death.... My
father is visibly failing. Perhaps I may get him yet to do
as I wish. In the meantime I have written plainly to my
brother David, to see if he will settle on my wife and daughters,
in case of his succeeding. I shall now know whether trade has
destroyed his liberal spirit.”</p>

<p class="p1">Amidst his many aberrations, and in spite of Dr. Johnson’s
discouragement, Boswell put into shape his travels in the
Hebrides. He forwarded the MS. to Johnson, who remarked
on it to Mrs. Thrale, “One would think the man had been hired
to be a spy upon me.” To Boswell he conveyed Mrs. Thrale’s
favourable judgment, but reserved his own. On this subject
Boswell thus communicated with Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Dr. Johnson has said nothing to me of my remarks during
my journey with him which I wish to write. Shall I task
myself to write so much of them a week, and send you for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
revisal? If I do not publish them now they will be good
materials for my ‘Life of Dr. Johnson.’”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 9th October Boswell was enabled to rejoice in an important
event,&mdash;Mrs. Boswell presented him with a son. To
Mr. Temple he wrote on the 6th November:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My wife is recovered remarkably well. This son has been
quite a cordial to her. He has been a little unlucky; the nurse
had not milk enough, and as he is a big-boned fellow he cannot
subsist without plentiful sustenance. We have got another
nurse, a strong, healthy woman, with an abundant breast. His
mother is quite unfit for nursing, she is of a temper so exceedingly
anxious.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell named his infant son Alexander, after his father. The
compliment was well received, and in a few months afterwards
Boswell was relieved of all apprehensions respecting his inheritance.
By his father he was consulted as to the provisions of a
deed of entail. He solicited counsel from Dr. Johnson<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and
Lord Hailes on a point respecting which he and his father disagreed.
Lord Auchinleck proposed that in the series of heirs to
be established under the entail, all males descending from his
grandfather should be preferred to females, but he would not
extend that privilege to males deriving their descent from a
higher source. Boswell, on the other hand, desired that heirs
male, however remote, should be preferred. As both Dr. Johnson
and Lord Hailes supported the view of Lord Auchinleck, and
Boswell at length acquiesced in his father’s wishes, the entail,
a document extending to thirty-seven folio pages, was executed
at Edinburgh on the 7th August, 1776. The instrument proceeds
thus:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I ALEXANDER BOSWEL of Auchinleck Esquire one
of the Senators of the College of Justice considering that
having long intended to make a full settlement of my estate,
but which I have put off a long time, not having fallen upon a
plan which gave me satisfaction, notwithstanding I have seen a
multiplicity of settlements, I am now come to the resolution to
execute what follows, which though it appears to me better
calculated to answer the ends of a family settlement, and to be
more free from objections than others I have seen, I am conscious
is not exempt from faults, for I see them. But when one is
providing for futurity it is impossible to obviate all inconveniences.
I have, however, chose this form as appearing to
me subject to the fewest. The Settlement I am to make is a
Taillie or Deed of Entail intended to be perpetual, which notwithstanding
the prejudices of the ignorant and dissipated part
of mankind to the contrary I have always approved of, if
properly devised. My motive to it is not the preservation of my
name and memory, for I know that after death our places here
know us no more. But my motives are that the strength of the
happy constitution with which this kingdom is blest, depends
in a great measure upon there being kept up a proper number of
Gentlemen’s families of independent fortunes. It was this which
at first introduced the right of primogeniture amongst us, a
right well adapted to the good of the younger, as well as the
eldest, as it prevents estates crumbling down by division into
morsels. It enables the several successive heirs to educate their
whole children properly, and thereby fit them for different
employments, so that these families are useful nurseries. On
the other hand a danger arises from an accumulation of different
estates into the hands of overgrown rich men. Again the
estate which I have, though not great, is sufficient for answering
all the reasonable expenses of a gentleman’s family and is
situate in an agreeable country with the people of which I and
my worthy predecessors have had the happiness to live in great
friendship, which I hope shall always be the case with those that
succeed me; and the place of residence has many uncommon
beauties and conveniences, which several considerations would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
make any wise man careful to preserve such an estate. But as
an heir may happen to get it who by weakness or extravagance
would soon put an end to it, I cannot think any wise man will
condemn me if while I allow the heirs of Taillie every power which
a man of judgment would wish to exercise, I restrain them only
from acting foolishly. If a person saw his next heir a weak
foolish and extravagant person he would justly be censured if in
place of giving his estate to his other children, or bestowing it
upon some worthy friend who would make a proper use of it, he
let it drop into the hands of a person who had nothing to
recommend him but the legal character of an heir who directly
on his succession would let it fly. I say he would justly be
censured for this unless he laid that unhappy heir under proper
restraints. And if this would be an advisable precaution to
follow where the person is seen, it must be equally so whenever
an heir happens to exist of that unhappy disposition at any
period however remote, for no time can come when any reasonable
man can think it would be beneficial to allow a person to
act foolishly, do therefore hereby,&mdash;with the special advice
and consent of James Boswell, Esquire, Advocate, younger of
Auchinleck my eldest son, and under these impressions and in
the hope and belief that I have fallen on a method of preventing
children from being independent of their parents and of securing
a proper provision for younger children, not only at first, which
is all that is commonly done, but in all future times, the want
of which appeared to me the most solid objection to Taillies&mdash;give,
grant, and dispose heretably and Irredeemably to myself
and the heirs male procreated and to be procreated of my
body whom failing the lands of Auchinleck to Dr. John Boswell
physician in Edinburgh my brother german and the heirs male
lawfully procreated or to be procreated of his body, whom failing
to Claude Boswell of Balmuto Esquire advocate, only son of the
deceast John Boswell of Balmuto who was the only brother of
the deceast Mr. James Boswell of Auchinleck advocate my father
and the heirs male lawfully procreated or to be procreated of
the body of the said Claude Boswell, whom failing to the heirs
whatsoever lawfully procreated or to be procreated of my body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
whom failing, to my own nearest heirs whatsoever descended
of the body of Thomas Boswell of Auchinleck my predecessor,
whom all failing to my own nearest heirs and assignies whatsoever&mdash;the
eldest heir female and the descendants of her body
always excluding heirs portioners and succeeding still without
division, throughout the whole course of succession of heirs
whatsoever as well as heirs of provision.”</p>

<p class="p1">After excluding from the succession all fatuous persons, and
regulating annuities for females and younger children, Lord
Auchinleck proceeds to guard against the extinction of the family
name.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is hereby,” he adds, “specially provided and declared
That in case any of the heirs male of my body who shall
succeed to my said lands and estate shall also succeed to a
peerage or to any other estate entailed under such conditions
as may restrain the heir from carrying my name and arms
then and in every such case the person so succeeding to the said
peerage or other such entailed estate when he is possessed of
my said estate or succeeding to my estate when having right
to such peerage or possessed of such other entailed estate shall
forfeit all right and title to my said lands and estate and that
not only for himself but also for his apparent heir and for all the
apparent heirs of such an apparent heir in a direct line downwards
whether in a nearer or remoter degree and my said estate
shall devolve and belong to the next heir of Taillie though
descending of the body of the person excluded or of his apparent
heir in the same manner as if the person excluded and all the
apparent heirs in the said peerage were naturally dead.”</p>

<p class="p1">On Friday, the 15th March, 1776, Boswell arrived in London.
Four days thereafter he accompanied Dr. Johnson, first to
Oxford and afterwards to Lichfield. At Oxford they had agreeable
intercourse with Dr. Wetherell, Master of University
College; Dr. Adams, Master of Pembroke College; Dr. Bentham,
Professor of Divinity; Mr. Thomas Warton, and Dr. Horne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Bishop of Norwich. <i>En route</i> for Lichfield they paused at
Birmingham, to visit Dr. Johnson’s schoolfellow, Mr. Hector.
Boswell improved the occasion by visiting, at Soho, Mr. Matthew
Boulton, the celebrated mechanician, and partner of James
Watt. Finding Mr. Boulton at the head of seven hundred
mechanics, he describes him as “an iron chief,” and a “father
to his tribe.” At Lichfield he was introduced to Mrs. Lucy
Porter, Dr. Johnson’s step-daughter, “an old maid, of simple
manners,” living on a fortune of £10,000 bequeathed to her
by her brother, a captain in the navy. On Friday, the 29th
March, the travellers returned to London.</p>

<p>Good Friday, which fell on the 5th of April, Boswell spent
with Dr. Johnson. They worshipped together morning and
evening in St. Clement’s Church. On Easter Sunday Boswell
attended morning service in St. Paul’s Cathedral, and in the
evening accompanied Dr. Johnson to his pew in St. Clement’s.</p>

<p>In the preceding January the brothers Daniel and Robert
Perreau were hanged for forgery. They were convicted on the
evidence of Margaret Caroline Rudd, who cohabited with one of
them, and who, to save her own life, proved informer. This
woman possessed uncommon powers of fascination, and it was
believed that she had duped the brothers into the crime for
which they suffered. Like other great criminals, Mrs. Rudd
had acquired a temporary celebrity, and on this account Boswell
determined to visit her. He carried out his intention, and
confessed himself charmed by Mrs. Rudd’s conversation and
manners. Under the plea that he would interest Mrs. Boswell,
he made a full record of Mrs. Rudd’s conversation, transmitting
the MS. to Mr. Temple, that he and his patron, Lord Lisburne,
might “enjoy” its perusal. To his many whims and vagaries
in the past Mr. Temple had submitted with more than befitting
good nature, but the celebration of Mrs. Rudd was beyond his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
endurance. He denounced the interview, and the record of it;
and Boswell, satisfied that he had been imprudent for once, took
back his MS.</p>

<p>Writing to Mr. Temple on the 28th April he remarks that he
“must eat commons in the Inner Temple this week and next,
to make out another term, that he may still be approximating to
the English Bar.” He then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I don’t know but you have spoken too highly of Gibbon’s
book; the Dean of Derry,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> who is of our club, as well as
Gibbon, talks of answering it. I think it is right that as fast
as infidel wasps or venomous insects, whether creeping or flying,
are hatched, they should be crushed. Murphy says he has read
thirty pages of Smith’s ‘Wealth,’ but says he shall read no
more. Smith too is now of our club. <i>It has lost its select
merit.</i> He has gone to Scotland at the request of David Hume,
who is said to be dying. General Paoli had a pretty remark
when I told him of this: “Ah! je suis fâché qu’il soit détrompé
si tôt.”</p>

<p class="p1">In a subsequent letter Boswell describes Gibbon as “an ugly,
affected, disgusting fellow,” adding, “he poisons our Literary
Club to me.” Gibbon was elected a member of the club in
March, 1774. With an agreeable presence and elegant
manners his conversational powers were of a high order. His
religious sentiments being obnoxious to Dr. Johnson led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Boswell’s personal dislike. Dr. Adam Smith was admitted to
the club on the 24th December, 1775. He and Dr. Johnson
had been at variance, but the quarrel was made up. Doubtless
in connection with this controversy Boswell thought meet to
censure the philosopher and his work. That a literary club which
had added to its membership Edward Gibbon and Adam Smith
should thereby have lost “its select merit,” reads strangely, even
as a <i>dictum</i> of James Boswell.</p>

<p>Boswell’s personal habits remained much the same. He
informed Mr. Temple that his “promise under the solemn yew”
had not been “religiously kept.” He had lately given “his word
of honour” to General Paoli that “he would not taste fermented
liquor for a year.” He adds, “I have kept the promise now
about three weeks; I was really growing a drunkard.”</p>

<p>At the end of April Boswell proceeded to Bath, and there
joined Dr. Johnson at the residence of the Thrales. He accompanied
Dr. Johnson to Bristol, where they inspected the church
of St. Mary, Redcliff, and discoursed on the genius and errors of
Chatterton. Returning to London, Boswell realized a project on
which he had set his heart&mdash;that of bringing together Dr. Johnson
and Mr. Wilkes. On this subject he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every
description had made me much about the same time obtain an
introduction to Dr. Samuel Johnson and to John Wilkes, Esq.
Two men more different could perhaps not be selected out of all
mankind. They had even attacked one another with some asperity
in their writings; yet I lived in habits of friendship with both.
I could fully relish the excellence of each, for I have ever delighted
in that intellectual chemistry which can separate good
qualities from evil in the same person.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell contrived a meeting between Dr. Johnson and Mr.
Wilkes by the exercise of considerable craft. Having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
invited to meet Mr. Wilkes at the table of Mr. Edward Dilly, he
bore a message from that gentleman to Dr. Johnson, requesting
him to join the party. In conveying it he played on the Doctor’s
“spirit of contradiction.” Having repeated Mr. Dilly’s message
without reference to the other guests, the following conversation
ensued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><i>Johnson</i>: “Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Dilly; I will wait upon
him.”</p>

<p><i>Boswell</i>: “Provided, sir, I suppose, that the company which
he is to have is agreeable to you?”</p>

<p><i>Johnson</i>: “What do you mean, sir? What do you take me
for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to imagine
that I am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to
have at his table?”</p>

<p><i>Boswell</i>: “I beg your pardon, sir, for wishing to prevent you
from meeting people whom you might not like. Perhaps he
may have some of what he calls his patriotic friends with him.”</p>

<p><i>Johnson</i>: “Well, sir, and what then? What care I for his
patriotic friends? Poh!”</p>

<p><i>Boswell</i>: “I should not be surprised to find Jack Wilkes
there.”</p>

<p><i>Johnson</i>: “And if Jack Wilkes should be there, what is that
to me, sir? My dear friend, let us have no more of this. I
am sorry to be angry with you, but it is treating me strangely
to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever occasionally.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">Johnson and Wilkes met not unpleasantly, and Boswell
had his triumph. In May he returned to Edinburgh. Before
leaving London he repeated to Dr. Johnson his former promise
that he would devote a portion of his time to reading. Johnson
despatched to him at Edinburgh several boxes of books, thereby
relieving his collection of supernumerary volumes, and by placing
on the books a marketable value discharging a debt which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he owed on the Hebridean journey. After an interval Boswell
reported that owing to a renewed attack of melancholy the boxes
remained unopened. Johnson in these words administered
reproof:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“To hear that you have not opened your boxes of books is
very offensive. The examination and arrangement of so many
volumes might have afforded you an amusement very seasonable
at present, and useful for the whole of life. I am, I confess,
very angry that you manage yourself so ill.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell opened the boxes, and found what he describes as
“truly a numerous and miscellaneous stall library thrown
together at random.” It was not further disturbed.</p>

<p>Boswell’s melancholy did not proceed from any constitutional
disorder. He was involved in debt, and his creditors were
importunate. His father was again appealed to, and the liabilities
were discharged. Rejoicing in his deliverance he communicated
the good news to Dr. Johnson. On the 16th November
the Doctor thus conveyed his congratulations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I had great pleasure in hearing that you are at last on good
terms with your father. Cultivate his kindness by all honest
and manly means. Life is but short: no time can be afforded
but for the indulgence of real sorrow, or contest upon questions
seriously momentous. Let us not throw away any of our days
upon useless resentment, or contend who shall hold out longest
in stubborn malignity. It is best not to be angry, and best, in
the next place, to be quickly reconciled. May you and your
father pass the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence!”</p>

<p class="p1">In December Mrs. Boswell presented her husband with a
second son, who was christened David. A delicate child, he
survived only a few months.</p>

<p>Writing to Dr. Johnson on the 8th July, 1777, Boswell
claims merit in having refrained from visiting London since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
spring of 1776, and proposes that the Doctor should meet him
at Carlisle, and from thence complete his tour of the English
cathedrals. To this proposal Johnson did not accede, but the
friends agreed to meet in September at Ashbourne, in the
hospitable residence of Dr. Taylor. At this meeting Boswell
intimated his desire to obtain a permanent residence in London
as an English barrister. This scheme Dr. Johnson warmly
disapproved, and entreated his companion to be satisfied with
his prospective advantages as a Scottish landowner.</p>

<p>In his more important legal causes Boswell had recourse to
Dr. Johnson’s assistance. At Ashbourne he asked help in a
case of importance. Joseph Knight, a negro, having been
brought to Jamaica in the usual course of the slave trade, was
purchased by a Scottish gentleman in the island, who afterwards
returned to Scotland. Soon after his arrival Knight claimed his
freedom, and brought an action to enforce it.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The case was
now pending, and Boswell induced Dr. Johnson to dictate an
argument on the negro’s behalf. In recording it he is careful
to add that he was personally an upholder of the slave trade.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“I record Dr. Johnson’s argument fairly upon this particular
case; where, perhaps, he was in the right. But I beg leave to
enter my most solemn protest against his general doctrine with
respect to the slave trade. For I will resolutely say that his
unfavourable notion of it was owing to prejudice and imperfect
or false information. The wild and dangerous attempt which
has for some time been persisted in to obtain an Act of our
Legislature to abolish so very important and necessary a branch
of commercial interest must have been crushed at once, had
not the insignificance of the zealots, who vainly took the lead
in it, made the vast body of planters, merchants, and others,
whose immense properties are involved in that trade, reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
enough suppose that there could be no danger. The encouragement
which the attempt has received excites my wonder
and indignation; and though some men of superior abilities
have supported it, whether from a love of temporary popularity
when prosperous, or a love of general mischief when desperate,
my opinion is unshaken. To abolish a <i>status</i> which in all ages
God has sanctioned and man has continued, would not only be
robbery to an innumerable class of our fellow-subjects, but
it would be extreme cruelty to the African savages, a portion of
whom it saves from massacre, or intolerable bondage in their
own country, and introduces into a much happier state of life,
especially now when their passage to the West Indies, and
their treatment there, is humanely regulated. To abolish that
trade would be to&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“&mdash;&mdash;Shut the gates of mercy on mankind.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The political success of Edmund Burke induced Boswell to
indicate his readiness to co-operate with him in regard to the
American colonies. To Mr. Burke he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq p1">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>Edinburgh, March 3, 1778.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Upon my honour I began a letter to you some
time ago, and did not finish it because I imagined you were then
near your <i>apotheosis</i>, as poor Goldsmith said upon a former
occasion, when he thought your party was coming into administration;
and being one of your old Barons of Scotland, my pride
could not brook the appearance of paying my court to a minister
amongst the crowd of interested expectants on his accession.
At present I take it for granted that I need be under no such
apprehension, and therefore I resume the indulgence of my
inclination. This may be perhaps a singular method of beginning
a correspondence; and in one sense may not be very
complimentative. But I can sincerely assure you, dear sir, that
I feel and mean a genuine compliment to Mr. Burke himself.
It is generally thought no meanness to solicit the notice and
favour of a man in power; and surely it is much less a meanness
to endeavour by honest means to have the honour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pleasure of being on an agreeable footing with a man of superior
knowledge, abilities, and genius.</p>

<p>“I have to thank you for the obligations which you have
already conferred upon me by the welcome which I have, upon
repeated occasions, experienced under your roof. When I was
last in London you gave me a general invitation, which I value
more than a Treasury warrant:&mdash;an invitation to ‘the feast of
reason,’ and, what I like still more, ‘the flow of soul,’ which
you dispense with liberal and elegant abundance, is, in my
estimation, a privilege of enjoying certain felicity; and we know
that riches and honour are desirable only as means to felicity,
and that they often fail of the end.</p>

<p>“Most heartily do I rejoice that our present ministers have at
last yielded to conciliation. For amidst all the sanguinary zeal
of my countrymen I have professed myself a friend to our
fellow-subjects in America, so far as they claim an exemption
from being taxed by the representatives of the King’s British
subjects. I do not perfectly agree with you; for I deny the
Declaratory Act, and I am a warm Tory in its true constitutional
sense. I wish I were a commissioner, or one of the
secretaries of the commission for the grand treaty. I am to be
in London this spring, and if his Majesty should ask me what I
would choose, my answer will be, to assist in the compact
between Britain and America. May I beg to hear from you,
and in the meantime to have my compliments made acceptable
to Mrs. Burke?&mdash;I am, dear sir, your most obedient, humble
servant,</p>

<p class="p1">On the 18th March Boswell arrived in London, and at
once renewed his intercourse with Dr. Johnson. They spent
Good Friday together, Boswell accompanying the lexicographer
to morning and evening service in St. Clement’s Church. Next
evening, while taking tea with him, Boswell severely experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Dr. Johnson’s resentment. The narrative we present in his own
words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We talked of a gentleman (Mr. Langton) who was running
out his fortune in London, and I said, ‘We must get him out
of it. All his friends must quarrel with him, and that will
soon drive him away.’ <i>Johnson</i>: ‘Nay, sir, we’ll send you to
him; if your company does not drive a man out of his house,
nothing will.’ This was a horrible shock, for which there was
no visible cause. I afterwards asked him why he had said so
harsh a thing. <i>Johnson</i>: ‘Because, sir, you made me angry
about the Americans.’ <i>Boswell</i>: ‘But why did you not take
your revenge directly?’ <i>Johnson</i> (<i>smiling</i>): ‘Because, sir, I
had nothing ready. A man cannot strike till he has his weapons.’
This,” adds Boswell, “was a candid and pleasant confession.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Dr. Johnson made a second attack a fortnight afterwards,
which Boswell endured with less patience. On the 2nd May
they met at Sir Joshua Reynolds’. The wits of Queen Anne’s
reign were talked of, when Boswell exclaimed, “How delightful
it must have been to have lived in the society of Pope, Swift,
Arbuthnot, Gay, and Bolingbroke! We have no such society
in our days.” Sir Joshua answered, “I think, Mr. Boswell,
you might be satisfied with your great friend’s conversation.”
“Nay, sir, Mr. Boswell is right,” said Johnson, “every man
wishes for preferment, and if Boswell had lived in those days
he would have obtained promotion.” “How so, sir?” asked
Sir Joshua. “Why, sir,” said Johnson, “he would have had
a high place in the Dunciad.” Boswell felt so much hurt
that, contrary to his custom, he omits the conversation.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He
refers to the occurrence in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Saturday, May 2, I dined with him at Sir Joshua
Reynolds’s, when there was a very large company, and a great
deal of conversation; but owing to some circumstance, which I
cannot now recollect, I have no record of any part of it,
except that there were several people there by no means of the
Johnsonian school, so that less attention was paid to him than
usual, which put him out of humour, and upon some imaginary
offence from me, he attacked me with such rudeness that I
was vexed and angry, because it gave those persons an opportunity
of enlarging upon his supposed ferocity, and ill-treatment
of his best friends. I was so much hurt, and had my pride so
much roused, that I kept away from him for a week, and perhaps
might have kept away much longer, nay, gone to Scotland without
seeing him again, had we not fortunately met and been
reconciled.”</p>

<p class="p1">The reconciliation is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Friday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Langton’s. I
was reserved and silent, which I supposed he perceived, and
might recollect the cause. After dinner, when Mr. Langton was
called out of the room and we were by ourselves, he drew his
chair near to mine and said, in a tone of conciliating courtesy,
‘Well, how have you done?’ <i>Boswell</i>: ‘Sir, you have made me
very uneasy by your behaviour to me at Sir Joshua Reynolds’s.
You know, my dear sir, no man has a greater respect and affection
for you, or would sooner go to the end of the world to serve
you. Now to treat me so&mdash;&mdash;’ He insisted that I had interrupted,
which I assured him was not the case, and proceeded,
‘But why treat me so before people who neither love you nor
me?’ ‘Well, I’m sorry for it. I’ll make it up to you twenty
different ways, as you please.’ <i>Boswell</i>: ‘I said to-day to Sir
Joshua, when he observed that you <i>tossed</i> me sometimes, I don’t
care how often or how high he tosses me when only friends are
present, for then I fall upon soft ground; but I do not like
falling on stones, which is the case when enemies are present.
I think this is a pretty good image, sir.’ <i>Johnson</i>: ‘Sir, it is one
of the happiest I have ever heard.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Boswell left London on the 19th of May. On his return to
Edinburgh he was seized with an irrepressible longing for an
early settlement in London, and forthwith communicated his
sentiments to Dr. Johnson. He had the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I wish you would a little correct or restrain your imagination,
and imagine that happiness such as life admits may be had
at other places as well as London. Without affecting stoicism,
it may be said that it is our business to exempt ourselves as
much as we can from the power of external things. There is
but one solid basis of happiness, and that is, the reasonable hope
of a happy futurity. This may be had everywhere. I do not
blame your preference of London to other places, for it is really
to be preferred if the choice is free; but few have the choice of
their place or their manner of life, and mere pleasure ought not
to be the prime motive of action.”</p>

<p class="p1">In August Mrs. Boswell gave birth to her third son, who was
christened James. Dr. Johnson sent suitable congratulations.</p>

<p>In March, 1779, Boswell again repaired to the metropolis. He
spent Good Friday with Dr. Johnson, attending him at both
diets of worship in St. Clement’s Church. Johnson, he relates,
preferred silent meditation during the interval of worship, and
for his improvement handed him “Les Pensées de Paschal,” a
book which he perused with reverence. On Easter Sunday he
worshipped in St. Paul’s, and afterwards dined with Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>A letter to Mr. Temple, which Boswell commenced at London
on the 31st May, and finished at Newcastle on the 8th June,
contains the following passages:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Had you been in London last week, you would have seen
your friend sadly changed for a little. So trifling a matter as
letting the nails of my great toes grow into the flesh, particularly
in one foot, produced so much pain and inflammation and lameness
and apprehension, that I was confined to bed, and my
spirits sank to dreary dejection.... I am now much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
better, but still unable to walk; and having received a very wise
letter from my dear, sensible, valuable wife, that although my
father is in no immediate danger, his indisposition is such that I
ought to be with him, I have resolved to set out to-morrow, being
the very first day after completing another term at the Temple....
Is it not curious that at times we are in so happy a
frame that not the least trace of former misery or vexation is
left upon the mind? But is not the contrary, too, experienced?&mdash;Gracious
Author of our being, do Thou bring us at length to
steady felicity.&mdash;What a strange, complicated scene is this
life! It always strikes me that we cannot seriously, closely,
and clearly examine almost any part of it. We are at pains to
bring up children, just to give them an opportunity of struggling
through cares and fatigues; but let us hope for gleams of joy
here, and a blaze hereafter.... I got into the fly at
Buckden, and had a very good journey. An agreeable young
widow nursed me, and supported my lame foot on her knee.
Am I not fortunate in having something about me that interests
most people at first sight in my favour?... You ask me
about Lowth’s ‘Isaiah.’ I never once heard it mentioned till I
asked Dr. Johnson about it.... I do not think Lowth an
engaging man; I sat a good while with him this last spring.
He said Dr. Johnson had <i>great genius</i>. I give you this as a
specimen of his talk, which seemed to me to be neither discriminating,
pointed, nor animated; yet he certainly has much
curious learning, and a good deal of critical sagacity....
I did not know Monboddo’s new book, ‘The Metaphysics of the
Ancients,’ had been advertised. I expect it will be found to be
a very wonderful performance. I think I gathered from a
conversation with him that he believes the ‘metempsychosis.’”</p>

<p class="p1">On his arrival in Edinburgh, learning that the celebrated
Mr. John Wesley was on a visit to the city, Boswell waited on
him with a letter from Dr. Johnson. The writer expressed a
wish that “worthy and religious men should be acquainted with
each other.” Mr. Wesley received Boswell with politeness, but
did not encourage any closer intimacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>For two months after his return to Scotland Boswell despatched
no letters to Dr. Johnson. He in this fashion made
trial of his friend’s fidelity. At length receiving a letter from
the Doctor inquiring for his welfare, he resolved “never again to
put him to the test.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The friendship which subsisted between Mrs. Boswell and
Mrs. Stuart, wife of the second son of John, third Earl of Bute,
has been referred to. Boswell was, we have seen, also a favourite
with Mrs. Stuart. To her regard for him Boswell delighted to
refer, however, inopportunely. In his <i>Boswelliana</i> he relates
that Lord Mountstuart having remarked that he resembled
Charles Fox, Colonel Stuart (Mrs. Stuart’s husband) ejaculated,
“You are much uglier.” Boswell replied, looking his tormentor
in the face, “Does your wife think so, Colonel James?”
Colonel Stuart knew Boswell intimately, and, in common with
his wife, enjoyed his humour and excused his egotism. Being
in command of the Bedfordshire Militia, he invited Boswell to
accompany him and the regiment to London and some other
stations. Boswell readily complied. He delighted “to accompany
a man of sterling good sense, information, discernment,
and conviviality,” and he hoped in his society “to have a second
crop, in one year, of London and Johnson.”</p>

<p>On Monday, 4th October, Boswell waited on Dr. Johnson,
thereafter attending him daily during a fortnight’s residence in
London. On the 18th October he departed for Chester, in
company with Colonel Stuart. He tarried a few hours at Lichfield,
where he visited some of Dr. Johnson’s relatives. His
proceedings at Chester are related in the following letter to
Mr. Temple, dated Edinburgh, 4th January, 1780:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“From London, after an excellent fortnight there, I accompanied
Colonel Stuart to Chester, to which town his regiment
was ordered from Leeds, and there I passed another fortnight in
mortal felicity. I had from my earliest years a love for the military
life, and there is in it an animation and relish of existence which
I have never found amongst any other set of men, except
players, with whom you know I once lived a great deal. At the
mess of Colonel Stuart’s regiment I was quite the great man, as
we used to say; and I was at the same time all joyous and gay.
Such was my home at Chester. But I had the good fortune to
be known to the bishop, who is one of the most distinguished
prelates for piety and eloquence, and one of the most pleasing
men in social life that you can imagine. His palace was open
to me, morning, noon, and night; and I was liberally entertained
at his hospitable board. At Chester, too, I found Dean Smith,
the translator of ‘Longinus,’ with whom you and I were so well
acquainted when we were studying under Mr. John Stevenson.
I was surprised to find him, for I somehow had imagined that
he was an ancient English author, comparatively speaking. He
is very old, but is quite cheerful and full of anecdotes. He lives
very retired, with a disagreeable wife, and they told me I was
the only man who had been in the deanery for a long time. I
found too at Chester Mr. Falconer, a gentleman of fortune and
extraordinary learning and knowledge, who is preparing a new
edition of Strabo, at the desire of the University of Oxford; he
was exceedingly obliging to me.”</p>

<p class="p1">At Chester Boswell found the young ladies to be especially
charming. Forgetting that he and his correspondent were both
married, he informed Mr. Temple that several of the ladies
had “capital fortunes.” He wrote to Dr. Johnson that he had
complimented Miss Letitia Bainston, niece of one of the prebendaries,
in these words:&mdash;“I have come to Chester, madam, I
cannot tell how; and far less can I tell how I am able to get
away from it.” In his journey from Chester to Scotland Boswell
lingered at Carlisle. He wrote to Dr. Johnson that he had
received the sacrament in the cathedral, and that it was “divinely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
cheering to him that there was a cathedral so near Auchinleck.”
Dr. Johnson reminded his correspondent that Carlisle cathedral
was at least one hundred and fifty miles from Auchinleck,
adding, “If you are pleased, it is so far well.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1777 Boswell obtained a connection with the
<i>London Magazine</i>. He then commenced in its pages a series of
papers, which he styled “The Hypochondriack.” These papers
are generally short, and often disconnected; they abound in allusions
to the writer’s personal tastes and peculiar opinions, while
classical quotations are interspersed without point and without
purpose. But Boswell was pleased to see himself in print, and
so he complacently reports to Mr. Temple, in January, 1780,
that his “Hypochondriack gets on wonderfully well.” In his
paper for March, 1780, he thus alludes to his love of dissipation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I do fairly acknowledge,” he writes, “that I love drinking;
that I have a constitutional inclination to indulge in fermented
liquors, and that were it not for the restraints of reason and
religion, I am afraid I should be as constant a votary of
Bacchus as any man.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p class="p1">At the close of his letter of January he informs Mr. Temple
that his father had been ill of fever, with his pulse at ninety-five;
he then begs a loan of £200, to satisfy a demand which
his father could not be informed of. The loan was not granted,
and Boswell afterwards sought repayment of an advance made to
his friend at a former period, and which remained undischarged.</p>

<p>In September Boswell experienced a family loss in the death of
Dr. John Boswell, his father’s brother. Of his deceased relative
he writes to Mr. Temple that he was “a good scholar and affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
relative,” but “had no conduct.” He adds, “He had a
strange kind of religion, but I flatter myself he will be ere long,
if he is not already in heaven.” This passage might imply
that in abandoning the Romish faith he had not abjured the
doctrine of purgatory; yet that doctrine is inconsistent with the
following aspiration contained in the same letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I comfort myself with the Christian revelation of our being
in a state of purification, and that we shall, in course of time,
attain to felicity. It is delightful, Temple, to look forward to
the period when you and I shall enjoy what we now imagine.
In the meantime let us be patient, and do what we can.”</p>

<p class="p1">Writing to Mr. Temple in November, Boswell thus refers to an
unpleasantness which had for some months subsisted between
him and his father:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I could not help smiling at the expostulation which you
suggest to me to try with my father. It would do admirably
with some fathers, but it would make mine much worse, for he
cannot bear that his son should talk with him as a man. I can
only lament his unmelting coldness to my wife and children, for
I fear it is hopeless to think of his ever being more affectionate
towards them. Yet it must be acknowledged that his paying
£1,000 of my debt some years ago was a large bounty. He
allows me £300 a year; but I find that what I gain by my
practice and that sum together will not support my family. I
have now two sons and three daughters. I am in hopes that my
father will augment my allowance to £400 a year. I was indeed
very imprudent in expressing my extreme aversion to his second
marriage; but since it took place I am conscious of having behaved
to himself and his lady with such respectful attention, and
imposed such restraint upon myself as is truly meritorious. The
woman is very implacable, and I imagine it is hardly possible
that she can ever be my friend. She, however, behaves much
better to the children than their grandfather does. We are all
to dine at my father’s to-day; he is better now than he has been
for several years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In thus writing Boswell lacked candour. Had he chosen to
observe his usual frankness he would not have heaped censure
on his father’s wife, but attributed the paternal resentment to
its true cause&mdash;the payment of that sum of £200 which
Mr. Temple had declined to lend. His correspondent’s advice
respecting the plan for a London settlement was, for the time
not unacceptable. On this subject he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your counsel to me to set my mind at rest, and be content
with promotion in Scotland, is, I believe, very wise. My brother
David enforced it earnestly. If my father lives a few years
longer, age will, I suppose, fix me here without any question;
for to embark in a new sphere when one is much after forty is
not advisable. Yet, my dear Temple, ambition to be in Parliament
or in the metropolis is very allowable. Perhaps my
exalted notions of public situation are fallacious, for I begin to
think that true elevation is to be acquired from study and
thinking, and that when one is used to the most eminent
situations they become familiar and insipid, and perhaps
vexatious.”</p>

<p class="p1">The embarrassed condition of his affairs kept Boswell in Scotland
during the whole of 1780. In March, 1781, he again presented
himself in London. Good Friday was, as usual, spent
with Dr. Johnson, the friends worshipping together in St.
Clement’s church. On Easter Sunday he performed his wonted
devotions in St. Paul’s Cathedral. Not long afterwards he
afforded sad evidence of persistent recklessness. Dining with the
Duke of Montrose, he became inebriated, and in this condition
joined an evening party at the Honourable Miss Monckton’s.
He talked incoherently, and Dr. Johnson, who was present,
endeavoured to shield him from observation.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Next, day being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
made conscious of his lamentable aberration, he despatched to
his hostess the following verses as an apology for violating good
manners:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Not that with th’ excellent Montrose</p>
<p class="pp7">I had the happiness to dine;</p>
<p class="pp6">Not that I late from table rose,</p>
<p class="pp7">From Graham’s wit, from generous wine;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“It was not these alone which led</p>
<p class="pp7">On sacred manners to encroach,</p>
<p class="pp6">And made me feel what most I dread,</p>
<p class="pp7">Johnson’s just frown and self-reproach:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But when I entered, not abashed,</p>
<p class="pp7">From your bright eyes were shot such rays,</p>
<p class="pp6">At once intoxication flashed,</p>
<p class="pp7">And all my frame was in a blaze.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But not a brilliant blaze, I own;</p>
<p class="pp7">Of the dull smoke I’m yet ashamed,</p>
<p class="pp6">I was a dreary ruin grown,</p>
<p class="pp7">And not enlightened, though enflamed.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Victim at once to wine and love,</p>
<p class="pp7">I hope, Maria, you’ll forgive;</p>
<p class="pp6">While I invoke the powers above,</p>
<p class="pp7">That henceforth I may wiser live.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell remained in London till the beginning of June. <i>En
route</i> for Scotland, he accompanied Dr. Johnson to Southill,
Bedfordshire, on a visit to Mr. Charles Dilly, publisher, who had
there established his country seat. The friends reached Southill
on Saturday, the 2nd June. Next day they accompanied Mr.
Dilly’s family to the parish church. Boswell remained behind to
receive the sacrament. During the evening he sought religious
conversation with Dr. Johnson, commencing thus:&mdash;“My dear
sir, I would fain be a good man; and I am very good now. I
fear God and honour the king; I wish to do no ill, and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
benevolent to all mankind.” Dr. Johnson said impressions were
deceitful and dangerous, and explained the nature of the Christian
atonement. Boswell requested him to repeat his remarks,
and proceeded to record them.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Neglecting the practice of his profession, Boswell became
wholly dependent on his allowance from Lord Auchinleck, and
again ran himself aground. He explained his condition to Dr.
Johnson as a reason why he could not visit London in the
spring of 1782, adding that could he possibly reach the metropolis,
he might obtain a post which would restore his fortunes.
Dr. Johnson replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“To come hither with such expectations at the expense of
borrowed money, which I find you know not where to borrow,
can hardly be considered prudent. I am sorry to find, what
your solicitations seem to imply, that you have already gone the
length of your credit. This is to set the quiet of your whole
life at hazard. If you anticipate your inheritance, you can at
last inherit nothing; all that you receive must pay for the past.
You must get a place, or pine in penury, with the empty name
of a great estate. Poverty, my dear friend, is so great an evil,
and pregnant with so much temptation, and so much misery,
that I cannot but earnestly enjoin you to avoid it. Live on
what you have; live if you can on less; do not borrow either
for vanity or pleasure; the vanity will end in shame, and the
pleasure in regret; stay therefore at home till you have saved
money for your journey hither.”</p>

<p class="p1">In a letter written some months subsequently, Johnson
resumed his discourse on the miseries of improvidence:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Whatever might have been your pleasure or mine, I know
not how I could have honestly advised you to come hither with
borrowed money. Do not accustom yourself to consider debt
only as an inconvenience; you will find it a calamity. Poverty
takes away so many means of doing good, and produces so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
inability to resist evil, both natural and moral, that it is by all
virtuous means to be avoided. Consider a man whose fortune
is very narrow; whatever be his rank by birth, or whatever his
reputation by intellectual excellence, what can he do, or what
evil can he prevent? That he cannot help the needy is evident;
he has nothing to spare. But perhaps his advice or admonition
may be useful. His poverty will destroy his influence; many
more can find that he is poor than that he is wise; and few will
reverence the understanding that is of so little advantage to its
owner. I say nothing of the personal wretchedness of a debtor,
which, however, has passed into a proverb.”</p>

<p class="p1">After a long illness, patiently borne, Lord Auchinleck died at
Edinburgh on the 31st August. He had settled on his eldest
son the ancestral estate, with an unencumbered rental of £1,600
a year. On receipt of the tidings, Dr. Johnson wrote to Boswell
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your father’s death had every circumstance that could
enable you to bear it; it was at a mature age, and it was
expected; and as his general life had been pious, his thoughts
had doubtless for many years past been turned upon eternity.
That you did not find him sensible must doubtless grieve you;
his disposition towards you was undoubtedly that of a kind,
though not of a fond father. Kindness, at least actual, is in our
power, but fondness is not; and if by negligence or imprudence
you had extinguished his fondness, he could not at will rekindle
it. Nothing then remained for you but mutual forgiveness of
each other’s faults, and mutual desire of each other’s happiness.
I shall long to know his final disposition of his fortune.”</p>

<p class="p1">On Friday, the 21st March, 1783, Boswell arrived in London.
He found Dr. Johnson at Mrs. Thrale’s in feeble health. As on
former occasions, the friends worshipped together in St. Clement’s
Church on Good Friday, while Boswell again kept Easter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
St. Paul’s. When congratulating his friend on his position as a
landowner, Dr. Johnson unsparingly exposed his egotism.
“Boswell,” said he, “you often vaunt so much, as to provoke
ridicule. You put me in mind of a man who was standing in the
kitchen of an inn with his back to the fire, and thus accosted the
person next him:&mdash;‘Do you know, sir, who I am?’ ‘No,
sir,’ said the other, ‘I have not that advantage.’ ‘Sir,’ said he,
‘I am the great Twamley, who invented the new floodgate
iron.’”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Boswell left London for Scotland on the 29th of May. From
Dr. Johnson he received these parting counsels:&mdash;“Get as much
force of mind as you can. Live within your income. Always
have something saved at the end of the year. Let your imports
be more than your exports, and you’ll never go far wrong.”</p>

<p>On the opening of Parliament in November, 1783, Mr. Fox introduced
in the House of Commons his celebrated East India Bill. By
this measure he proposed to vest the Government of India for five
years, in a commission of seven, who were to be appointed by Parliament,
and to be irremovable by the Crown. The Bill was accepted
by the Commons, but was, on the 17th December, rejected
in the Upper House, through the influence of the King. The rejection
of this measure compelled the coalition ministry to resign, and
Mr. Pitt became Prime Minister on the understanding that he
would appeal to the country without loss of time. Having
become a landowner, Boswell conceived himself a fit candidate
for parliamentary honours, and in prospect of a dissolution
resolved to offer his services to a constituency. He published a
pamphlet entitled “A Letter to the People of Scotland on the
Present State of the Nation” (43 pp. 12mo.). In this composition
he denounces Mr. Fox’s India Bill as “an attempt to deprive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the sovereign of his lawful authority;” and urges “his fellow-countrymen
in their several counties” to express their satisfaction
that the Bill had been rejected by the Lords. He celebrates
the memory of Sir John Lowther, ancestor of Lord Lowther,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
who had lately promised him support. Then, passing to his
favourite theme, he announces himself as “a firm loyalist,
holding an estate transmitted to him by charters from a
series of kings.” He concludes by the offer of parliamentary
service. His composition he transmitted to Dr. Johnson, begging
his opinion. The lexicographer was in declining health, and
was proportionally amiable. He complimented the writer on
his knowledge of constitutional history, adding that his pamphlet
would “raise his character, though it might not make him a
Minister of State.” Mr. Pitt sent a polite acknowledgment,
commending “the author’s zeal in the cause of the public.”</p>

<p>His “Letter to the People of Scotland” Boswell followed up
by the following address to the Ayrshire constituency:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“<i>To the Real Freeholders of the County of Ayr.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;If my friend Colonel Montgomerie shall not
be a candidate at the next election, I intend to offer my services
as your representative in Parliament. If Colonel Montgomerie
stands, he shall have my warmest support; for I have never
ceased to think that great injustice was done both to you and
him when he was deprived of the seat given him by your
voice; and I am very desirous to have ample reparation made
for that injustice. Indeed, gentlemen, you have at the two
last general elections been disappointed of your representation
by the unconstitutional means of those votes, which, upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
notice that I glory in having made, were, at a meeting of this
county, 29th October, 1782, declared to be <i>nominal</i> and
<i>fictitious</i>.</p>

<p>“Colonel Montgomerie and I will probably at no time be
on different sides. We are both connected with the respectable
old interest of the county; and I trust we should both be
exceedingly sorry to hurt it by a division, of which its enemies
are eagerly watchful to take advantage.</p>

<p>“I pledge my word and honour that if there is not a greater
number of the <i>real freeholders</i> for me than for any other candidate,
I shall retire from the contest. I disdain to avail myself
of what I condemn; and I am not callous enough to bear the
indignant and reproachful looks of my worthy neighbours, who
would consider that, by an artful use of the letter of that law
which so loudly calls for reformation, I had triumphed over
their wishes, and annihilated their most valuable privileges.</p>

<p>“My political principles I have avowed, in the most direct
and public manner, to be those of a steady Royalist, who
reveres monarchy, but is at the same time animated with
genuine feelings of liberty; principles which, when well understood,
are not in any degree inconsistent, but are happily
united in the true British Constitution.</p>

<p>“The confidences with which I have been honoured by many
of you in my profession as a lawyer, and other marks of
attention which you have been pleased to show me, emboldens
me to believe that you think well of my integrity and abilities.
On the other hand, I declare that I should pay the utmost
deference to your instructions as my constituents; and as I am
now the representative of a family which has held an estate
in the county, and maintained a respectable character for
almost three centuries, I flatter myself that I shall not be
reckoned too presumptuous when I aspire to the high distinction
of being your representative in Parliament, and that you
will not disapprove of my indulging an ambition that this
family shall rather advance than fall off in my time.</p>

<p>“Though I should not be successful at the next, or at any
future election, I am so fortunate as to have resources enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to prevent me from being discontented or fretful on that
account; and I shall ever be, with cordial regard,</p>

<p class="pr10">“Gentlemen,</p>
<p class="pr4">“Your very faithful, and most obedient, humble servant,</p>
<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">James Boswell</span>.</p>

<p>“<i>Auchinleck, March 17, 1784.</i>”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Boswell was at York on the 28th March, 1784, <i>en route</i> for
London, when he was informed that Parliament was dissolved.
Having in a brief note intimated to Dr. Johnson his political aspirations,
he posted to Ayrshire, to contest the county. From
Johnson he received a letter entreating him to be “scrupulous
in the use of strong liquors,” as “one night’s drunkenness
might defeat the labour of forty days well employed.”</p>

<p>On reaching Auchinleck, Boswell learned what he might
have ascertained sooner, that Colonel Montgomerie was
re-soliciting the suffrages of the constituency. He was
the successful candidate. Boswell again proceeded southward,
and on the 5th May reached London. He dined out almost
daily, frequently meeting Dr. Johnson, who though an
invalid, rejoiced in the intercourse of his friends. By his
physicians Johnson had been advised to proceed to Italy, and
as the journey was delayed, Boswell apprehended that his friend
was suffering from lack of funds. He applied to Lord Chancellor
Thurlow, entreating an augmentation of Johnson’s pension,
or a special grant for the Italian journey. To the Treasury the
Chancellor presented the application, but it was not entertained.
Dr. Johnson expressed his grateful sense of Boswell’s consideration
and enterprise.</p>

<p>After a period of severe suffering, Dr. Johnson expired on the
13th December, 1784. He had prepared an autobiography, but
destroyed it, with a portion of his correspondence, some weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
before his decease. He appointed no literary executor, nor left
instructions respecting a memoir. Boswell contemplated a different
result, but did not publicly complain. From respect to Johnson’s
wishes he had abstained from publishing his Hebridean tour. He
now seriously employed himself in preparing it for the printer. As
the first proof-sheet was being sent him from Mr. Baldwin’s printing
office, it happened to attract the attention of Mr. Edmund
Malone, who proceeded to read the account of Dr. Johnson’s
character. He was struck with the fidelity of the representation,
and begged Mr. Baldwin to introduce him to the writer.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Boswell rejoiced to cultivate the acquaintance of one who not
only belonged to Dr. Johnson’s circle, but was himself a celebrity,
as editor of Goldsmith’s works, and as a writer on
Shakespeare’s plays.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He visited Mr. Malone almost daily,
submitting to his revision the MS. of his work. Accompanied
by a flattering dedication to Mr. Malone, the work appeared in
1786 as a bulky octavo, bearing on the title-page the following
copious inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, with Samuel Johnson,
LL.D., by James Boswell, Esq., containing some poetical pieces
by Dr. Johnson, relative to the Tour, and never before published:
a series of his conversation, Literary Anecdotes, and Opinions of
Men and Books, with an authentick account of the Distresses
and Escape of the Grandson of King James II. in the year
1746.</p>

<p class="pi8s p1">‘O! while along the stream of time, thy name<br />
Expanded flies, and gathers all its fame,<br />
Say, shall my little book attendant sail,<br />
Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Above the imprint was placed a small woodcut representing
a falcon&mdash;the author’s crest, with his family motto, <i>vraye foy</i>.
The work was published by Mr. Charles Dilly, and the edition
was rapidly distributed. The author was thus commended by
Mr. Courtenay in his “Poetical Review:”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“With Reynolds’ pencil, vivid, bold and true<br />
So fervent Boswell gives him to our view:<br />
In every trait we see his mind expand;<br />
The master rises by the pupil’s hand:<br />
We love the writer, praise his happy vein,<br />
Graced with the <i>naiveté</i> of the sage Montaigne;<br />
Hence not alone are brighter parts display’d,<br />
But e’en the specks of character portray’d:<br />
We see the ‘Rambler’ with fastidious smile<br />

Deck’d in a kilt, he wields a chieftain’s arms;<br />
The tuneful piper sounds a martial strain,<br />
And Samuel sings ‘The King shall have his <i>ain</i>.’</p>

<p class="pc ls4">****</p>

<p class="pp12">“Can Boswell be forgot,</p>
<p class="pp6">Scarce by North Britons now esteem’d a Scot?<br />
Who to the sage devoted from his youth<br />
Imbib’d from him the sacred love of truth;<br />
The keen research, the exercise of mind,<br />
And that best art, the art to know mankind.”</p>

<p class="p1">Much as his performance was appreciated by friendly persons,
it was impossible that Boswell’s morbid egotism should escape
ridicule. Thomas Rowlandson, the noted caricaturist, issued
twenty cartoons, presenting the unguarded tourist in absurd and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
grotesque scenes and attitudes, founded on descriptions in his
book. They were placed in the shop windows and hawked
about the streets, while the laughter-rousing Peter Pindar<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
addressed Boswell in a “Poetical and Congratulatory Epistle,”
mercilessly castigating him in sarcastic and crushing rhymes.
Here is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp12 p1">“At length, ambitious Thane, thy rage</p>
<p class="pp6">To give one spark to Fame’s bespangled page<br />
Is amply gratified. A thousand eyes<br />
Survey thy book with rapture and surprize!<br />
Loud of thy tour, a thousand tongues have spoken,<br />
And wonder’d that thy bones were never broken.</p>

<p class="pc ls4">*****</p>

<p class="pp6">Nay, though thy Johnson ne’er had bless’d thine eyes,<br />
Paoli’s deeds had rais’d thee to the skies;<br />
Yes! his broad wing had rais’d thee (no bad luck)<br />
A tomtit twitt’ring on an eagle’s back.”</p>

<p class="p1">Equally pungent was the savage Pindar in a subsequent poem,
entitled “Bozzy and Piozzi.” He wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“For thee, James Boswell, may the hand of Fate<br />
Arrest thy goose-quill and confine thy prate!<br />
Thine egotism the world disgusted hears&mdash;<br />
Then load with vanities no more our ears.<br />
Like some lone puppy, yelping all night long,<br />
That tires the very echoes with his tongue.<br />
Yet, should it lie beyond the pow’rs of Fate<br />
To stop thy pen, and still thy darling prate;<br />
To live in solitude, oh! be thy luck<br />
A chattering magpie on the Isle of Muck.”</p>

<p class="p1">Than the shafts of ridicule, Boswell experienced even more
substantial discomfort. Respecting Sir Alexander Macdonald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Bart., chief of the Macdonalds, he had written thus unguardedly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Instead of finding the head of the Macdonalds surrounded
with his clan, and a festive entertainment, we had a small company,
and cannot boast of our cheer. The particulars are
minuted in my Journal, but I shall not trouble the publick
with them. I shall mention but one characteristick circumstance.
My shrewd and hearty friend Sir Thomas (Wentworth) Blacket,
Lady Macdonald’s uncle, who had preceded us on a visit to this
chief, upon being asked by him if the punch-bowl then upon the
table was not a very handsome one, replied, ‘Yes,&mdash;if it were
full.’ Sir Alexander Macdonald having been an Eton scholar,
Dr. Johnson had formed an opinion of him which was much
diminished when he beheld him in the Isle of Skye, where we
heard heavy complaints of rents racked, and the people driven
to emigration. Dr. Johnson said, ‘It grieves me to see the
chief of a great clan appear to such disadvantage. This gentleman
has talents, nay, some learning; but he is totally unfit for
this situation. Sir, the Highland chiefs should not be allowed
to go farther south than Aberdeen. A strong-minded man, like
his brother Sir James, may be improved by an English education,
but in general they will be turned into insignificance.’ I
meditated an escape from this house the very next day; but
Dr. Johnson resolved that we should weather it out till Monday.”</p>

<p class="p1">In charging the chief of the Macdonalds with an unwarrantable
parsimony, Boswell is justified in a letter written by Dr. Johnson
to Mrs. Thrale.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But he evinced his wonted imprudence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
making public what had better have been concealed, and in
dragging into the controversy Sir Thomas Blacket, a near relative
of Sir Alexander’s wife.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Both baronets made loud complaint,
and the chief of the Macdonalds spoke of vengeance by personal
chastisement. To this threat Peter Pindar thus pungently
alludes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Let Lord Macdonald<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> threat thy breech to kick,<br />
And o’er thy shrinking shoulders shake his stick<br />
Treat with contempt the menace of this Lord,<br />
’Tis Hist’ry’s province, Bozzy, to record.”</p>

<p class="p1">The displeasure which Boswell had excited was appeased by
a compromise. He agreed in his next edition to exclude Blacket’s
anecdote, and to substitute allusion to Macdonald’s shabbiness
by quoting his Latin verses, welcoming the lexicographer to Skye.</p>

<p>In 1786 Boswell executed his Will, and it seems probable that
“the apprehension of danger to his life”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> to which in that
document he refers was due to the menace of the Highland
chief. If this conjecture is well founded, it is interesting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
remark that Boswell especially provides that his own tenantry
should in the matter of rent be treated with leniency.</p>

<p>In the preface to his third edition, issued in 1786, Boswell
vigorously denounces his critics on both sides the Tweed. His
Scottish compeers, he alleges, have displayed “a petty national
spirit unworthy of his countrymen.” The English critics are
styled “shallow and envious cavillers.” In opposition to their
assertions that he has <i>lessened</i> Dr. Johnson’s character, he
maintains that he was assured by persons of taste that he had
<i>greatly heightened</i> it. He appeals to the judgment of posterity.</p>

<p>Elated by his popularity as a tourist, he determined to reassert
his political pretensions. An opportunity for displaying
patriotic ardour seasonably occurred. A Bill was introduced
into the House of Commons by Mr. Islay Campbell,
the Lord Advocate, and Mr. Dundas, Dean of Faculty,
for reconstructing the Court of Session. By this Bill it was
proposed to reduce the judges from fifteen to ten, and
with the funds secured by the reduction to augment the
salaries of those who remained. In opposition to this
measure Boswell issued a pamphlet, sensationally entitled “A
Letter to the People of Scotland on the alarming attempt to
infringe the Articles of Union, and introduce a most pernicious
innovation, by diminishing the number of the Lords of Session.”
This composition, extending to 107 octavo pages, was published
by Dilly, and sold for half a crown. There were few sales, but
copies of the pamphlet were presented to the author’s friends.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>In his characteristic manner Boswell sets forth that the number
of judges was fixed unalterably by the Act of Union, “an Act
which, entering into the constitution of Parliament itself, Parliament
dare not alter.” The number of fifteen was declared by
George Buchanan to be small enough to avoid the character of a
tyrannical junto.&mdash;“Is a court of ten,” he proceeds, “the same with
a court of fifteen? Is a two-legged animal the same with a four-legged
animal? I know nobody who will gravely defend that
proposition, except one grotesque philosopher, whom ludicrous
fable represents as going about avowing his hunger, and wagging
his tail, fain to become cannibal and eat his deceased
brethren.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Lords of Session, he argues, do the work of English
juries in civil cases, and exercise the functions of English Grand
Juries. Mr. Dundas he denounces as “Harry the Ninth,” and
Mr. Islay Campbell is censured, though less abusively. Boswell
next introduces himself, and proceeds to expatiate on his personal
merits. He had in his previous letter “kindled the fire of
loyalty and saved the constitution.” He is “a true patriot,”
and begs that he may not be misunderstood by associating with
Mr. Wilkes, “he being so pleasant,” and an “old classical companion.”
He declares himself a scholar and a gentleman&mdash;“a
scholar,” as he is familiar with Latin authors; and a gentleman,
“since his friends were persons of title and influence.” His
wife, whom “he loved as dearly as when she gave him her
hand,” is “a relation of Lord Eglinton, a true Montgomery.”
The M.P. for Plymouth, Captain Macbride, is “the cousin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
his wife, and the friend of his heart.” His intimate friend,
Colonel Stuart, has “sterling good sense, information, discernment,
honour, honesty, and spirit.” Lord Lowther is apostrophised
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Let not the Scottish spirit be bowed. Let Lowther come
forth and support us. We are his neighbours. <i>Paries proximus
ardet.</i> We all know what <span class="smcap">HE</span> can do. He upon whom the
thousands of Whitehaven depend for <i>three</i> of the elements. <i>He</i>
whose soul is all great; whose resentment is terrible, but whose
liberality is boundless. I know that he is dignified by having hosts
of enemies; but I have fixed his character in my mind upon no
slight inquiry. I have traversed Cumberland and Westmoreland;
I have sojourned at Carlisle and at Kendal; I know of the
Lonsdale Club at Lancaster. Lowther! be kindly interested.
Come over to Macedonia, and help us. With such personal
qualities and such friends Boswell holds himself admirably
qualified for a seat in the Legislature. He will present himself
at next election as a candidate for Ayrshire. I have reason
to hope,” he proceeds, “that many of the real freeholders of
Ayrshire will support me at the election for next Parliament,
against which I have declared myself a candidate. I shall certainly
stand upon the substantial interest of the gentlemen of
landed property; and if upon a fair trial I should not succeed
in that object of ambition, which I have most ardently at heart,
I have resources enough to prevent me from being discontented
and fretful.”</p>

<p class="p1">The project of settling in London and forming a connection
with the English Bar, which Boswell had long cherished, was
now to be carried out. After keeping his terms, according to the
usual practice, he was called to the English Bar, at Hilary
term, 1786. His professional <i>debût</i> prognosticated failure.
Some of the junior barristers, to whom he was known as <i>Johnson’s
Bozzy</i>, prepared an imaginary case full of absurdity, which was
submitted for his opinion. Unsuspecting a trap, he prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
an elaborate note of judgment. The laughter was prodigious, and
the merriment penetrated into private circles. A ridiculous appearance
in court, made soon afterwards, put a final check on
his career as a practising barrister.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> About three years after
joining the English Bar he represented his condition to Mr.
Temple in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>London, January 10th, 1789.</i></p>

<p>“I am sadly discouraged by having no practice nor probable
prospect of it; and to confess fairly to you, my friend, I am
afraid that were I to be tried, I should be found so deficient in
the forms, the quirks, and the quiddities, which early habit
acquires, that I should expose myself. Yet the delusion of
Westminster Hall, of brilliant reputation and splendid fortune
as a barrister, still weighs upon my imagination. I must be
seen in the courts, and must hope for some happy openings in
causes of importance. The Chancellor, as you observe, has not
done as I expected; but why did I expect it? I am going to
put him to the test. Could I be satisfied with being Baron of
Auchinleck, with a good income for a gentleman in Scotland, I
might, no doubt, be independent. But what can be done to
deaden the ambition which has ever raged in my veins like a
fever? In the country I should sink into wretched gloom, or at
best into listless dulness and sordid abstraction. Perhaps a
time may come when I may by lapse of time be grown fit for it. As
yet I, really from a philosophical spirit, allow myself to be driven
along the tide of life with a good deal of caution not to be much
hurt; and still flattering myself that an unexpected lucky chance
may at last place me so that the prediction of a fortunate cap
appearing on my head at my birth will be fulfilled.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Not long after writing this letter Boswell obtained his only
professional appointment; he was, through the influence of Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Lowther, appointed Recorder of Carlisle. The emoluments of
the office were small, and as an attendance of several weeks
was required annually, the acquisition was inconsiderable. But
the wits did not permit the new Recorder to enter on his post
without ridicule. The following <i>jeu d’esprit</i> obtained circulation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Boswell once flamed with patriot zeal,</p>
<p class="pp7">His bow was ever bent;</p>
<p class="pp6">How he no public wrongs can feel</p>
<p class="pp7">Till Lowther nods assent.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">To seize the throne which faction tries,</p>
<p class="pp7">And would the Prince command,</p>
<p class="pp6">The Tory Boswell coolly cries,</p>
<p class="pp7">My King’s in Westmoreland.”</p>

<p class="p1">At the close of the first edition of Boswell’s Tour to the
Hebrides, appeared the following advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pc1">“Preparing for the Press, in one volume quarto,<br />
The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.<br />
By James Boswell, Esq.</p>

<p class="p1">“Mr. Boswell has been collecting materials for this work for
more than twenty years, during which he was honoured with
the intimate friendship of Dr. Johnson; to whose memory he
is ambitious to erect a literary monument, worthy of so great an
authour, and so excellent a man. Dr. Johnson was well informed
of his design, and obligingly communicated to him several
curious particulars. With these will be interwoven the most
authentick accounts that can be obtained from those who knew
him best; many sketches of his conversation on a multiplicity
of subjects, with various persons, some of them the most
eminent of the age; a great number of letters from him at
different periods, and several original pieces dictated by him to
Mr. Boswell, distinguished by that peculiar energy which
marked every emanation of his mind.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">This advertisement, more befitting the announcement of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
play than the memoir of a moralist, did not escape the witty
criticism of the sarcastic Pindar. In a postscript to his
“Poetical Epistle” he has thus written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“As Mr. Boswell’s ‘Journal’ hath afforded such universal
pleasure, by the relation of minute incidents and the great
moralist’s opinion of men and things during his northern tour, it
will be adding greatly to the anecdotical treasury, as well as
making Mr. B. happy, to communicate part of a dialogue that took
place between Dr. Johnson and the author of this congratulatory
epistle, a few months before the Doctor paid the great debt of
nature. The Doctor was very cheerful that day, had on a black
coat and waistcoat, a black plush pair of breeches, and black
worsted stockings, a handsome grey wig, a shirt, a muslin neckcloth,
a black pair of buttons in his shirt-sleeves, a pair of shoes
ornamented with the very identical little buckles that accompanied
the philosopher to the Hebrides; his nails were very
neatly pared, and his beard fresh shaved with a razor fabricated
by the ingenious Mr. Savigny.</p>

<p>“<i>P. P.</i>: ‘Pray, Doctor, what is your opinion of Mr. Boswell’s
literary powers?’</p>

<p>“<i>Johnson</i>: ‘Sir, my opinion is, that whenever Bozzy expires,
he will create no vacuum in the region of literature&mdash;he
seems strongly affected by the <i>cacoëches scribendi</i>; wishes to be
thought a <i>rara avis</i>, and in truth so he is&mdash;your knowledge in
ornithology, sir, will easily discover to what species of bird I
allude.’ Here the Doctor shook his head and laughed.</p>

<p>“<i>P. P.</i>: ‘What think you, sir, of his account of Corsica?&mdash;of
his character of Paoli?’</p>

<p>“<i>Johnson</i>: ‘Sir, he hath made a mountain of a wart. But
Paoli hath virtues. The account is a farrago of disgusting
egotism and pompous inanity.’</p>

<p>“<i>P. P.</i>: ‘I have heard it whispered, Doctor, that should you
die before him, Mr. B. means to write your life.’</p>

<p>“<i>Johnson</i>: ‘Sir, he cannot mean me so irreparable an injury,&mdash;which
of us shall die first, is only known to the Great
Disposer of events; but were I sure that James Boswell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
would write <i>my</i> life, I do not know whether I would not
anticipate the measure by taking <i>his</i>.’ (Here he made three
or four strides across the room, and returned to his chair with
violent emotion.)</p>

<p>“<i>P. P.</i>: ‘I am afraid that he means to do you the favour.’</p>

<p>“<i>Johnson</i>: ‘He dares not&mdash;he would make a scarecrow of
me. I give him liberty to fire his blunderbuss in <i>his own</i> face,
but not murder <i>me</i>, sir. I heed not his [Greek: autos epha]. Boswell
write my life! why, the fellow possesses not abilities for writing
the life of an ephemeron.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Naturally indolent and procrastinating, Boswell was, like
persons of his temperament, aroused to enterprise by harsh
and ungenerous criticism. Johnson’s “Life” was commenced at
once, and for some time prosecuted vigorously. Abandoned for
many months, it was taken up in 1787, and worked upon at
intervals in the year following.</p>

<p>The progress of the undertaking is in February 1788, thus
reported to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Mason’s Life of Gray is excellent, because it is interspersed
with letters which show us the man.... I am absolutely certain
that my mode of biography, which gives not only a history of
Johnson’s visible progress through the world, and of his publications,
but a view of his mind in his letters and conversations,
is the most perfect that can be conceived, and will be more of a
life than any work that has ever yet appeared. I have been
wretchedly dissipated, so that I have not written a line for a
fortnight; but to-day I resume my pen, and shall labour
vigorously.”</p>

<p class="p1">To Mr. Temple a further report is presented in January,
1789:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am now very near my rough draft of Johnson’s Life. On
Saturday I finished the Introduction and Dedication to Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Joshua, both of which had appeared very difficult to be accomplished.
I am confident they are well done. Whenever I have
completed the rough draft, by which I mean the work without
nice correction, Malone and I are to prepare one-half
perfectly, and then it goes to press, whence I hope to have it
early in February, so as to be out by the end of May.”</p>

<p class="p1">After joining the English Bar, and establishing his headquarters
in London, Boswell rented inexpensive chambers near
the law courts; but in the winter of 1788-9 he removed to
a house in Queen Anne Street West, Cavendish Square. He
was joined by his two sons, and his daughter Veronica,&mdash;the
sons attending an academy in Soho. His attendants were “a
butler and Scotch housekeeper,” whom he kept “on account
of their fidelity and moderate wages.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Boswell made a trial of London, but soon returned to
Auchinleck. She disapproved her husband’s preference for the
English Bar, and feared that the fogs of London would prove
injurious to her health. She had been an asthmatic patient, and
at the commencement of 1789 the complaint returned in an
aggravated form. Writing to Mr. Temple on the 5th March,
Boswell expresses himself deeply concerned about his “valuable
and affectionate wife,” but he feels that joining her in the country
would destroy the completion of the Life of Johnson, and remove
him from “the great whirl of the metropolis,” from which he
hoped “in time to have a capital prize.” He had visited Ayrshire
at the close of 1788, and there prosecuted an active canvass
among his supposed friends, the parliamentary freeholders. The
visit and its prospective results are thus detailed to Mr.
Temple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr2 p1">“<i>London, 10th January, 1789.</i></p>

<p>“As to my canvass in my own county, I started in opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to a junction between Lord Eglintoun and Sir Adam Fergusson,
who were violent opponents, and whose coalition is as odious
there as the Great One is to the nation. A few friends and real
independent gentlemen early declared for me; three other noble
lords, the Earls of Cassilis, Glencairn, and Dumfries, have lately
joined and set up a nephew of the Earl of Cassilis: a Mr. John
Whitefoord, who as yet stands as I do, will, I understand, make
a bargain with this alliance. Supposing he does, the two great
parties will be so poised that I shall have it in my power to cast
the balance. If they are so piqued that either will rather give
the seat to me than be beaten by the other, I may have it.
Thus I stand, and I shall be firm. Should Lord Lonsdale give
me a seat he would do well, but I have no claim upon him
for it. In the matter of the regency he adds that he had
‘almost written one of his very warm popular pamphlets in
favour of the Prince;’ but as Lord Lonsdale was ill, and he had
no opportunity of learning his sentiments, he had ‘prudently
refrained.’ He accuses Pitt of ‘behaving very ill,’ in neglecting
him, and denounces Dundas ‘as a sad fellow in his
private capacity.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Boswell returned to Ayrshire in April. Mrs. Boswell had
written that she was “wasting away,” and her physician was
not hopeful of her improvement. Her husband thus describes
her condition to Mr. Temple:<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I found,” he writes, “my dear wife as ill, or rather worse
than I apprehended. The consuming hectic fever had preyed
upon her incessantly during the winter and spring, and she was
miserably emaciated and weak. The physician and surgeon-apothecary,
whom she allows occasionally, though rarely, to visit
her, told me fairly, as to a man able to support with firmness
what they announced, that they had no hopes of her
recovery, though she might linger they could not say how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
long.... No man ever had a higher esteem or a warmer
love for a wife than I have for her. You will recollect, my
Temple, how our marriage was the result of an attachment
truly romantic; yet how painful is it to me to recollect a
thousand instances of inconsistent conduct! I can justify,”
he adds, “my removing to the great sphere of England upon
a principle of laudable ambition, but the frequent scenes of what
I must call dissolute conduct are inexcusable; and often and
often, when she was very ill in London, have I been indulging in
festivity with Sir Joshua Reynolds, Courtenay, Malone, &amp;c., and
have come home late and disturbed her repose.”</p>

<p class="p1">In these expressions of affection Boswell was sincere, but he
would have better indicated regret for past inattention to his
suffering helpmate if his conduct during her last illness had been
more suited to her condition. During the five weeks he remained
at Auchinleck, he was, according to his own acknowledgment,
“repeatedly from home,” and both “on these occasions,
and when neighbours visited him, drank too much wine.”
Returning from a neighbour’s house in a state of inebriety,
he experienced an accident, the particulars of which he thus
related to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On Saturday last, dining at a gentleman’s house where I was
visiting for the first time, and was eager to obtain political influence;
I drank so freely that, riding home in the dark without
a servant, I fell from my horse and bruised my shoulder
severely. Next morning I had it examined by a surgeon, who
found no fracture or dislocation, but blooded me largely to
prevent inflammation.”</p>

<p class="p1">The presence in Auchinleck House of one whose habits were
so irregular, and who had narrowly escaped death in a fit of
drunkenness, was not likely to soothe the dying gentlewoman.
Some days after the occurrence of his accident, Boswell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
invited by a friend of Lord Lonsdale to accompany his lordship
in an early journey to London. Though still a sufferer and in
bed on account of his fall, he resolved to obey the summons,
and Mrs. Boswell “animated him to set out.” With his arm in
a sling he posted to Carlisle. Reaching Lowther Castle, he
found Lord Lonsdale “in no hurry to proceed on the London
journey.” Meanwhile his shoulder became more uneasy, the
pain extending to the breast and over the entire arm, so that he
was unable to put on his clothes without help.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Two weeks after he had reached London a letter from the
Auchinleck physician informed him that Mrs. Boswell was
rapidly sinking. He at once set out for Ayrshire, accompanied by
his two sons, and, as he is particular in relating, the journey was
performed in “sixty-four hours and a quarter.” On his arrival he
found that Mrs. Boswell had died four days before. In a letter
to Mr. Temple, dated 3rd July, he wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I cried bitterly and upbraided myself for leaving her, for she
would not have left me. This reflection, my dear friend, will, I fear,
pursue me to my grave.... I could hardly bring myself to
agree that the body should be removed, for it was still a consolation
to me to go and kneel by it, and talk to my dear, dear
Peggy.... Her funeral was remarkably well attended.
There were nineteen carriages followed the hearse, and a
large body of horsemen, and the tenants of all my lands.
It is not customary in Scotland for a husband to attend a wife’s
funeral, but I resolved, if I possibly could, to do her the last
honours myself; and I was able to go through it very decently.
I privately read the funeral service over her coffin in presence of
my sons, and was relieved by that ceremony a good deal. On
the Sunday after Mr. Dun delivered, almost <i>verbatim</i>, a few
sentences which I sent him as a character of her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Boswell’s religious views were still unsettled. During his
wife’s illness he wrote to Mr. Temple, “What aid can my wife
have from religion, except a pious resignation to the great and
good God? for indeed she is too shrewd to receive the common
topics; she is keen and penetrating.” What “the common
topics” were, belief in which Boswell regarded with contempt,
he has not informed us, and it might be hazardous to conjecture.</p>

<p>The dissolution of Parliament expected in the spring of 1789
did not occur, but the representation of Ayrshire became vacant
in July, owing to the acceptance of a public office by the sitting
member, Colonel Montgomerie. Obtaining intimation of the
vacancy, Boswell, four weeks a widower, hastened from London
to Ayrshire to renew his claims. There were two other candidates&mdash;Sir
Adam Fergusson and Mr. John Whitefoord. The
former was chosen. Boswell informed Mr. Temple that “he
would make an admirable figure even if he should be unsuccessful.”
He stood alone!</p>

<p>Since his failure at the English Bar, Boswell had been most
energetic in the pursuit of patronage. He rested his hopes on
Mr. Dundas and Mr. Pitt, but more especially on Mr. Burke
and Lord Lonsdale. Concerning the two former he thus communicated
with Mr. Temple in the spring of 1789. After censuring
Mr. Dundas for neglecting to promote his brother David, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“As to myself, Dundas, though he <i>pledged himself</i> (as the
modern phrase is) to assist me in advancing in promotion, and
though he last year assured me, upon his honour, that my letter
concerning the Scottish judges made no difference; yet, except
when I in a manner compelled him to dine with me last winter,
he has entirely avoided me, and I strongly suspect has given Pitt
a prejudice against me. The excellent Langton says it is disgraceful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it is utter folly in Pitt not to reward and attach to his
administration a man of my popular and pleasant talents, whose
merit he has acknowledged in a letter under his own hand. He
did not answer several letters which I wrote at intervals, requesting
to wait upon him; I lately wrote to him that such behaviour
to me was certainly not generous. ‘I think it is not just, and
(forgive the freedom) I doubt if it be wise. If I do not hear from
you in ten days, I shall conclude that you are inclined to have
no further communication with me; for I assure you, sir, I am
extremely unwilling to give you, or indeed myself, unnecessary
trouble.’ About two months have elapsed, and <i>he has made
no sign</i>. How can I still delude myself with dreams of rising in
the great sphere of life.”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Burke knew Boswell’s good qualities, and had sought to
befriend him. In 1782 he recommended him for employment
to General Conway,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> though without success. Boswell still hoped
to obtain a post through his influence, and not infrequently
reminded him that he was unprovided for. To Mr. Temple,
in March, 1789, he describes Mr. Burke in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I cannot help thinking with you that Pitt is the ablest and
most useful minister of any of those whom we know; yet I am
not sure that after the <i>pericula</i> which should give caution, others
(and amongst them Burke, whom I visited yesterday, and found
as ably philosophical in political disquisition as ever) might not
do as well; and if he has treated me unjustly in his stewardship
for the public, and behaved with ungrateful insolence to my
<i>patron</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> who first introduced him into public life, may I not warrantably
arraign many articles, and great ones too, in his conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
which I can attack with forcible energy? At present I keep
myself quiet, and wait till we see how things will turn out.”</p>

<p class="p1">While thus distrusting or despising his other patrons, Boswell
rested strongly on Lord Lonsdale. To Mr. Temple he communicated
in March that his lordship showed him “more and more
regard.” He was his last star of hope; but the setting was at
hand.</p>

<p>Checked in his legal, political, and parliamentary aspirations,
Boswell began to devote some attention to family affairs. By
his brother David he was advised to return to Scotland, and there
attend to the education of his children. Concerning this proposal
he remarks to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Undoubtedly my having a house in Edinburgh would be
best for them (the children); but, besides that my withdrawing
thither would cut me off from all those chances which may
in time raise me in life, I could not possibly endure Edinburgh
now, unless I were to have a judge’s place to bear me up; and
even then I should deeply sigh for the metropolis.”</p>

<p class="p1">He determined to remain in London. Plans for the disposal
of his children were, after much wavering, at length
resolved upon. Alexander, his eldest son, having “begun to
oppose him,”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> was removed from Soho Academy to Eton. He
was afterwards to be sent to the University of Edinburgh, and
latterly to Holland and Germany for the study of civil law.
James, the second son, described to Mr. Temple as “an extraordinary
boy, much of his father,” was to be educated as a barrister.
Meanwhile, being in his eleventh year, he was to be continued at
the Soho school. Veronica, the eldest daughter, was kept in
London under the charge of Mrs. Buchanan, a widow.
Euphemia, the second daughter, was sent to a boarding-school in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Edinburgh; and Elizabeth, the youngest, was placed in an educational
institution at Ayr. By thus dispersing the members of
his family, Boswell secured himself against any interference with
his habits. For his children the arrangement was salutary,
since they could not have profited by the exhibition of his
weaknesses.</p>

<p>Amidst incessant place-hunting and a round of social indulgences,
the “Life of Johnson” proceeded slowly. The public were
meanwhile entertained by Mrs. Piozzi’s Anecdotes.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> This work
and the “Life of Johnson,” by Sir John Hawkins, seemed to
satisfy general curiosity. The latter work, which appeared in
1787, deeply mortified Boswell; he was mentioned in it only
once, and then as “Mr. James Boswell, a native of Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Indignation inspired him with energy. As specimens of his
forthcoming work, he issued in quarto form two portions of
its contents, with these titles:&mdash;“The Celebrated Letter from
Samuel Johnson, LL.D., to Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of
Chesterfield, now first published, with notes by James Boswell,
Esq. London: Printed by Henry Baldwin for Charles Dilly, in
the Poultry, 1790. [Price Half a Guinea.]” “A Conversation
between His Most Sacred Majesty George III. and Samuel
Johnson, LL.D., illustrated with Observations by James Boswell,
Esq. London: Printed by Henry Baldwin for Charles Dilly, in
the Poultry, 1790. [Price Half a Guinea.]”</p>

<p>The former of these <i>fasciculi</i> occupied four, and the latter
eight quarto pages. Intimating to Mr. Temple that “a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his <i>magnum opus</i> was ready for the press,” he added that
Hawkins should not be spared. His labours were interrupted by
Mrs. Boswell’s illness and his return to inebriate habits. On
the 28th November he wrote to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Let me first address you from Cato:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi12 p1">‘Thou best of friends,</p>
<p class="pi6">Pardon a weak distemper’d soul that swells,<br />
In sudden gusts, and sinks again in calms.’</p>

<p class="p1">Your last letter supposes too truly my situation. With grief
continually at my heart, I have been endeavouring to seek relief
in dissipation and in wine, so that my life for some time past has
been unworthy of myself, of you, and of all that is valuable in
my character and connections. For a week past, as the common
phrase is, ‘I have taken up,’ and by a more regular and quiet
course find myself, I think, rather better.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">As in the case of his “Tour to the Hebrides,” Boswell submitted
each successive chapter of the “Life of Johnson” to the revision of
Mr. Malone. In his letter to Mr. Temple of the 28th November
he remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The revision of my ‘Life of Johnson’ by so acute and knowing
a critic as Mr. Malone is of most essential consequence,
especially as he is <i>Johnsonianissimus</i>; and as he is to hasten to
Ireland as soon as his Shakspere<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> is fairly published, I must
avail myself of him <i>now</i>. His hospitality and my other invitations,
and particularly my attendance at Lord Lonsdale’s, have
lost us many evenings; but I reckon that a third of the work is
settled, so that I shall get to press very soon. You cannot imagine
what labour, what perplexity, what vexation I have endured
in arranging a prodigious multiplicity of materials, in supplying
omissions, in searching for papers, buried in different masses,
and all this besides the exertion of composing and polishing.
Many a time have I thought of giving it up. However, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I shall be uneasily sensible of its many deficiencies, it will certainly
be to the world a very valuable and peculiar volume of
biography, full of literary and characteristical anecdotes (which
word, by the way, Johnson always condemned, as used in the
sense that the French, and we from them, use it, as signifying
particulars), told with authenticity, and in a lively manner.
Would that it were in the booksellers’ shops! Methinks, if I
had this <i>magnum opus</i> launched, the public has no further claim
upon me; for I have promised no more, and I may die in peace,
or retire into dull obscurity, <i>reddarque tenebris</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Writing to Mr. Temple on the 8th February, 1790, Boswell
thus reports progress:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am within a short walk of Mr. Malone, who revises my
‘Life of Johnson’ with me. We have not yet gone over quite
a half of it, but it is at last fairly in the press. I intended to
have printed it upon what is called an <i>English</i> letter, which
would have made it look better; but upon calculation it would
have made two quarto volumes, and two quarto volumes for one
life would have appeared exorbitant, though in truth it is a
view of much of the literature, and many of the literary men of
Great Britain for more than half a century. I have therefore
taken a smaller type, called <i>Pica</i>, and even upon that I am afraid
its bulk will be very large. It is curious to observe how a
printer calculates; he arranges a number of pages, and the words
in them at different parts of the ‘copy’ (as the MS. is called),
and so finds the number of words. Mine here are four hundred
and one thousand six hundred. Does not this frighten
you. By printing a page the number of words it holds is
discovered; and by dividing the sum-total of words by that number
we get the number of pages. Mine will be eight hundred.
I think it will be, without exception, the most entertaining book
you ever read. I cannot be done with printing before the end
of August.”</p>

<p class="p1">In excellent terms with himself, and rejoicing in his literary
aptitude, he thus addresses Mr. Temple on the 13th February:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I dine in a different company almost every day, at least
scarcely ever twice running in the same company, so that I have
fresh accessions of ideas. I drink with Lord Lonsdale one day;
the next I am quiet in Malone’s elegant study revising my
Life of Johnson, of which I have high expectations, both as to
fame and profit. I surely have the art of writing agreeably.
The Lord Chancellor<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> told me he had read every word of my
Hebridean Journal; he could not help it.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 4th December Boswell addressed Mr. Malone:<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The <i>magnum opus</i> advances. I have revised p. 216. The
additions which I have received are a Spanish quotation from
Mr. Cambridge, an account of Johnson at Warley Camp from
Mr. Langton, and Johnson’s letters to Mr. Hastings&mdash;three
in all,&mdash;one of them long and admirable; but what sets the
diamonds in pure gold of Ophir is a letter from Mr. Hastings
to me, illustrating them and their writer. I had this day the
honour of a long visit from the late Governor-General of India.
There is to be no more impeachment. But you will see his
character nobly vindicated, depend upon this.”</p>

<p class="p1">Though still ambitious of professional advancement, Boswell
began to dread the merriment of the Circuit mess, promoted too
frequently at his personal cost. On the plea of saving £50,
and “avoiding rough, unpleasant company,” he informed Mr.
Temple in February, 1789, that he would omit the spring Northern
Circuit. In August he communicated to the same correspondent
that he had proceeded to Lord Lonsdale’s with the intention of
joining the autumn Circuit at Carlisle; but that considering
his “late severe loss,” and “the rough scenes of the roaring, bantering
society of lawyers,” he preferred to remain at Lowther
Castle. At the castle he was subjected to a practical jest, which
as an annoying incident he thus describes to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A strange accident happened; the house at Lowther was
so crowded that I and two other gentlemen were laid in one
room. On Thursday morning my wig was missing; a strict
search was made, all in vain. I was obliged to go all day
in my night-cap, and absent myself from a party of ladies
and gentlemen who went and dined with the Earl on the banks
of the lake,&mdash;a piece of amusement which I was glad to shun,
as well as a dance which they had at night. But I was in a
ludicrous situation. I suspected a wanton trick which some
people think witty; but I thought it very ill-timed to one in my
situation. Next morning the Earl and a colonel, who I thought
might have concealed my wig, declared to me, upon honour
they did not know where it was; and the conjecture was that a
clergyman who was in the room with me, and had packed up
his portmanteau in a great hurry to set out in the morning
early, might have put it up among his things. This is very improbable;
but I could not long remain an object of laughter, so
I went twenty-five miles to Carlisle on Tuesday, and luckily
got a wig there fitted for me in a few hours.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 13th October Boswell informed Mr. Temple that on
lately visiting Lowther Castle he received back his wig. “The
way in which it was lost,” he adds, “will remain as secret as
the author of Junius.”</p>

<p>Mr. Temple became urgent for repayment of a loan of £200,
and in obtaining the necessary means Boswell severely taxed
his resources. Referring to the debt, he assured his correspondent
that he had, after deducting family costs, a free
income of not more than £350, and that while he had been in
straitened circumstances for twenty years, he dreaded that his
embarrassments would continue. In a letter dated 28th November
he returns to his pecuniary difficulties.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The state of my affairs is very disagreeable; but be not
afraid of your £200, as you may depend upon its being repaid.
My rent-roll is above £1,600; but deducting annuities, interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of debts, and expenses absolutely necessary at Auchinleck, I
have but about £850 to spend. I reckon my five children at
£500 a year. You see what remains for myself.”... “I
am this year to make one trial of the Lord Chancellor. In
short, I cast about everywhere. I do not see the smallest
opening in Westminster Hall; but I like the scene, though I
have attended only one day this last term, being eager to get
my ‘Life of Johnson’ finished. And the delusion that practice
may come at any time (which is certainly true) still possesses
me.” He adds, “I have given up my house, and taken good
chambers in the Inner Temple, to have the appearance of a
lawyer. O Temple! Temple! is this realizing any of the
towering hopes which have so often been the subject of our conversation
and letters? Yet I live much with a great man, who,
upon any day that his fancy shall be so inclined, may obtain for
me an office which would make me independent.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell could cherish no reasonable hope of professional
advancement, save through the patronage of Lord Lonsdale.
And the recent escapade at Lowther Castle might have shown
him that sentiments of respect were unassociated with his
lordship’s friendship. What he could not perceive in August,
1789, was made sufficiently plain in the following June. The
narrative must be presented in his own words. Writing from
Carlisle to Mr. Temple on the 21st June, 1790, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“At no period during our long friendship have I been more
unhappy than at present. The day on which I was obliged to
set out from London I had no time allowed me after a most
shocking conversation with Lord Lonsdale, and I hastened home
in hopes of finding you, but you were gone out. It was to
inform you that upon his seeing me by no means in good
humour, he challenged it roughly, and said, ‘I suppose you
thought I was to bring you into Parliament. I never had any
such intention.’ In short, he expressed himself in the most
degrading manner, in presence of a low man from Carlisle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
one of his menial servants. The miserable state of low spirits
I had, as you too well know, laboured under for some time
before made me almost sink under such unexpected insulting
behaviour. He insisted rigorously on my having solicited the
office of Recorder of Carlisle; and that I could not, without
using him ill resign it until the duties which were now
required of it were fulfilled, and without a sufficient time being
given for the election of a successor. Thus was I dragged away
as wretched as a convict; and in my fretfulness I used such
expressions as excited him almost to fury, so that he used such
expressions towards me that I should have, according to the
irrational laws of honour sanctioned by the world, been under the
necessity of risking my life, had not an explanation taken place....
I am down at an inn, in wretched spirits, and
ashamed and sunk on account of the disappointment of hopes
which led me to endure such grievances. I deserve all that I
suffer. I may be kept hanging on for weeks, till the election
and Midsummer Sessions are over; and I am at the same time
distracted what to do in my own county, as to the state of
which I expect letters every day. I am quite in a fever. O
my old and most intimate friend, what a shocking state am I
now reduced to! I entreat of you, if you possibly can, to afford
me some consolation, directed to me here, and pray do not
divulge my mortification. I will endeavour to appear indifferent;
and as I now resign my Recordership, I shall gradually get rid
of all communication with this brutal fellow.”</p>

<p class="p1">In Boswell’s correspondence Lord Lonsdale’s name only reappears
once. Writing to Mr. Temple on the 21st July, he
remarks, “I parted from the northern tyrant in a strange
equivocal state, for he was half irritated, half reconciled; but I
promise you I shall keep myself quite independent of him.”</p>

<p>Parliament was dissolved in July, and Boswell proposed once
more to offer his services to the Ayrshire constituency. He
ultimately determined more wisely, remarking to Mr. Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that “he did not go to Ayrshire, finding that he could only show
how small a party he had.”</p>

<p>Amidst these distractions, Boswell found leisure warmly to
interest himself in two objects to which he had pledged his
support. The first of these was to obtain subscribers for two
volumes of sermons, published by his former tutor and early
friend, Mr. John Dun, parish minister of Auchinleck.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In
these volumes the reverend author attempted to ridicule the
poet Burns. The following verses, a parody on the bard’s
“Address to the Deil,” were regarded by Boswell without
disfavour:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“<span class="smcap">The Deil’s Answer to his verra Freend R. Burns.</span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“So zealous Robin, stout an’ fell,<br />
True champion for the cause o’ hell,<br />
Thou beats the righteous down pell mell,</p>
<p class="pp12">Sae frank and frothy,</p>
<p class="pp6">That o’ a seat where devils dwell,</p>
<p class="pp12">There’s nane mair worthy.</p>

<p class="pc ls5">****</p>

<p class="pp6q">“Thou does as weel’s could be expectit,<br />

<p class="pp12">Ca’ worthless blether;</p>
<p class="pp6">But be na feart, ye’s get your due,</p>

<p class="pc ls5">****</p>

<p class="pp6q">“In hell when I read o’er your sang,<br />

<p class="pp12">An’ that’s be seen.</p>
<p class="pp6">Giff Nick should on me ride the stang</p>
<p class="pp12">To Aberdeen.”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Dun’s work was still-born. In a letter to Mr. Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Boswell regrets that his friend would, by his performance, be
“a sad loser.”</p>

<p>While thus abetting the ridicule of the Ayrshire poet,
Boswell’s other enterprize was more creditable. He gave
assistance in raising funds for a monument to Dr. Johnson in
Westminster Abbey. To this undertaking he thus refers in a
letter to Mr. Temple, dated the 28th November, 1789:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Last Sunday I dined with him (Malone), with Sir Joshua
Reynolds, Sir Joseph Banks, Mr. Metcalfe, Mr. Windham, Mr.
Courtenay, and young Mr. Burke, being a select number of
Dr. Johnson’s friends, to settle as to effectual measures for
having a monument erected to him in Westminster Abbey;
it is to be a whole-length statue of him, by Bacon, which will
cost £600. Sir Joshua and Sir William Scott, his executors,
are to send circular letters to a number of people, of whom
we make a list, as supposing they will contribute. Several
of us subscribed five guineas each, Sir Joshua and Metcalfe
ten guineas each, Courtenay and young Burke two guineas
each. Will you not be one of us, were it but for one
guinea? We expect that the Bench of Bishops will be liberal,
as he was the greatest supporter of the hierarchy. That
venerable sound brings to my mind the ruffians of France, who
are attempting to destroy all order, ecclesiastical and civil.
The present state of that country is an intellectual earthquake,
a whirlwind, a mad insurrection, without any immediate cause,
and therefore we see to what a horrible anarchy it tends.”</p>

<p class="p1">The subject of the monument is resumed in Boswell’s letter
to Mr. Temple, dated 8th February, 1790:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq p1">

<p class="p1">“You will have seen that Johnson’s friends have been
exerting themselves for his monument, which is to cost six
hundred guineas. We have now near to £400 of the money.
Can we have no Cornish coin? I wish you could assist us in
your neighbourhood. As your character of Gray was adopted
by him it would appear well if you sent two guineas. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
shall have a great dispute as to the epitaph. Flood, the orator,
though a distinguished scholar, says it should be in English, as
a compliment to Johnson’s having perpetuated our language;
he has compressed his opinion in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi8q p1">“No need of Latin, or of Greek to grace</p>
<p class="pi9">Our Johnson’s memory and inscribe his grave;</p>
<p class="pi8">His native tongue demands this mournful space,</p>
<p class="pi9">To pay the immortality he gave.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Johnson’s monument in Westminster Abbey was erected in
1796 at the cost of eleven hundred guineas; it was inscribed
with a Latin epitaph composed by Dr. Parr. Mr. Temple’s
name does not appear among the subscribers.</p>

<p>With the entire prostration of his political and professional
expectations, Boswell relapsed into melancholy. In a letter
to Mr. Temple dated 21st July he expresses himself in this
earnest manner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Surely, my dear friend, there must be another world in
which such beings as we are will have our misery compensated.
But is not this a state of probation? and if it is, how awful is
the consideration! I am struck with your question, ‘Have
you confidence in the Divine aid?’ In truth I am sensible
that I do not sufficiently ‘<i>try</i> my ways’ as the Psalmist says,
and am ever almost inclined to think with you <i>that</i> my great
<i>oracle Johnson did allow too much credit to good principles,
without good practice</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">In this passage Dr. Johnson’s sentiments on practical religion
are strangely perverted. Had not the great moralist warned
his companion against vanity and self-deceit, and the substitution
of good intentions for the active practice of virtue? In
the autumn of 1790, Boswell’s intemperance was excessive. On
the 4th December, he wrote to Mr. Malone in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the day after your departure, that most friendly fellow
Courtenay<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> (begging the pardon of an M.P. for so free an
epithet) called on me, and took my word and honour that, till
the 1st of March, my allowance of wine per diem should not
exceed four good glasses at dinner, and a pint after it; and
this I have kept, though I have dined with Jack Wilkes; at
the London Tavern, after the launch of an Indiaman with dear
Edwards; Dilly; at home with Courtenay; Dr. Barrow; at
the mess of the Coldstream; at the Club; at Warren Hastings’;
at Hawkins the Cornish member’s; and at home with a
colonel of the guards, &amp;c. This regulation, I assure you, is of
essential advantage in many respects.”</p>

<p class="p1">Like the vow under “the solemn yew” at Mamhead, the
word of honour pledged to Mr. Courtenay was soon forgotten.
On the 25th February, 1791, Boswell wrote to Mr. Malone as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your friendly admonition as to excess in wine has been
often too applicable; but upon this late occasion I erred on the
other side. However as I am now free from my restriction to
Courtenay I shall be much upon my guard; for, to tell the
truth, I did go too deep the day before yesterday, having dined
with Michael Angelo Taylor, and then supped at the London
Tavern with the stewards of the Humane Society.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his letter of the 4th December, Boswell affirms that his
promise of sobriety extended till the 1st of March; he reports
on the 25th of February, that the term had closed! His
melancholy had returned. On the 7th of February Mr. Temple
was addressed thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Before this time you have been informed of my having had
a most miserable return of bad spirits. Not only have I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a total distaste of life, but have been perpetually gnawed by a
kind of mental fever. It is really shocking that human nature
is liable to such inexplicable distress. Oh, my friend, what can
I do? * * * Your observation in a former letter, as to time
being measured not only by days and years, but by an advancement
in life, is new and striking, and is brought home to us
both, especially to me, who have obtained no advancement
whatever; but let me not harass you with my complaints.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his next letter to Mr. Temple, written on the 2nd of
April, Boswell further expatiates on his melancholy. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Your kindness to me fairly makes me shed tears. Alas! I
fear that my constitutional melancholy, which returns in such
dismal fits, and is now aggravated by the loss of my valuable
wife, must prevent me from any permanent felicity in this life.
I snatch gratifications, but have no comfort, at least very little;
yet your encouraging letters make me think at times that I
may yet, by God’s blessing, attain to a portion of happiness,
such as philosophy and religion concur in assuring us that
this state of progressive being allows. I get bad rest in the
night, and then I brood over all my complaints, the sickly
mind which I have had from my early years&mdash;the disappointment
of my hopes of success in life&mdash;the irrevocable separation
between me and that excellent woman, who was my cousin,
my friend and my wife; the embarrassment of my affairs&mdash;the
disadvantage to my children in having so wretched a father&mdash;nay,
the want of absolute certainty of being happy after death,
the <i>sure prospect</i> of which is frightful.”</p>

<p class="p1">Within a few months after sustaining that bereavement,
which he still deplored, Boswell contemplated the repair of his
shattered fortunes by contracting a second marriage. While
in the North he wrote Mr. Temple in July, 1790. “I got such
accounts of the lady of fortune, whose reputation you heard
something of, that I was quite determined to make no advances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Whether I shall take any such step I doubt much. The loss
I have experienced is perpetually recurring.”</p>

<p>Boswell resolved closely to watch his opportunity. His
letter to Mr. Temple of the 2nd April, 1791, contains the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am to dine with Sir William Scott, the King’s Advocate,
at the Commons to-morrow, and shall have a serious consultation
with him, as he has always encouraged me. It is to be a
family party, where I am to meet Miss Bagnal (his lady’s
sister) who may probably have six or seven hundred a year.
She is about seven and twenty, and he tells me lively and gay&mdash;a
Ranelagh girl&mdash;but of excellent principles, insomuch that she
reads prayers to the servants in her father’s family every
Sunday evening. ‘Let me see such a woman,’ cried I; and
accordingly I am to see her. She has refused young and fine
gentlemen. ‘Bravo,’ cried I, ‘we see then what her taste is.’
Here then I am, my Temple, my flattering self! A scheme&mdash;an
adventure seizes my fancy. Perhaps I may not like her;
and what should I do with such a companion, unless she
should really take a particular liking to me, which is surely
not probable; and, as I am conscious of my distempered mind,
could I <i>honestly</i> persuade her to unite her fate with mine. As
to my daughters, did I see a rational prospect of so good a
scheme, I should not neglect it on their account, though I
should certainly be liberal to them.”</p>

<p class="p1">Miss Bagnal’s name does not reappear. But he informs
Mr. Temple on the 22nd of August that his matrimonial
plans were still active:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You must know,” he writes, “I have had several matrimonial
schemes of late. I shall amuse you with them from
Auchinleck. One was Miss Milles, daughter of the late Dean
of Exeter, a most agreeable woman ‘<i>d’un certain âge</i>,’ and with
a fortune of £10,000; she has left town for the summer. It
was no small circumstance that she said to me, ‘Mr. Temple is
a charming man.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The progress of Boswell’s <i>magnum opus</i> has been traced to
the 4th December, 1790. On the 12th of that month the author
wrote to Mr. Temple:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My work has met with a delay for a little while&mdash;not a
whole day, however&mdash;by an unaccountable neglect in having
paper enough in readiness. I have now before me p. 256. My
utmost wish is to come forth on Shrove Tuesday (8th March).”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Malone was now in Ireland, and Boswell, in reporting to
him the progress of his undertaking, also communicated the
miserable details of his private embarrassments. In a letter to
Mr. Malone, dated the 18th January, 1791, he writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have been so disturbed by sad money matters that my
mind has been quite fretful; £500 which I borrowed and lent
to a first cousin, an unlucky captain of an Indiaman, were due
on the 15th to a merchant in the city. I could not possibly
raise that sum, and was apprehensive of being hardly used.
He, however, indulged me with an allowance to make partial
payments, £150 in two months, £150 in eight months, and the
remainder, with the interests, in eighteen months. How I am
to manage I am at a loss, and I know you cannot help me.
So this, upon my honour, is no hint. I am really tempted to
accept of the £1000 for my life of Johnson. Yet it would go
to my heart to sell it at a price which I think much too low.
Let me struggle and hope. I cannot be out on Shrove
Tuesday as I flattered myself. P. 376 of Vol. II. is ordered
for the press, and I expect another proof to-night. But I
have yet near 200 pages of copy, besides letters, and <i>the death</i>,
which is not yet written.”</p>

<p class="p1">Writing to Mr. Malone on the 29th January, Boswell makes
these deplorable revelations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have for some weeks had the most woeful return of
melancholy, insomuch that I have not only had no relish of
anything, but a continual uneasiness and all the prospect
before me for the rest of life has seemed gloomy and hopeless.
The state of my affairs is exceedingly embarrassed. I mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to you that the £500 which I borrowed several years
ago and lent to a first cousin, an unfortunate India captain,
must now be paid; £150 on the 18th of March, £150 on the
18th October, and £257 15s. 6d. on the 18th July, 1792. This
debt presses upon my mind, and it is uncertain if I shall ever
get a shilling of it again. The clear money on which I can
reckon out of my estate is scarcely £900 a year. What can
I do? My grave brother urges me to quit London and live
at my seat in the country, where he thinks that I might be
able to save so as gradually to relieve myself. But, alas! I
should be <i>absolutely</i> miserable. In the meantime such are my
projects and sanguine expectations, that you know I purchased
an estate which was given long ago to a younger son of our
family, and came to be sold last autumn, and paid for it £2500,
£1500 of which I borrow upon itself by a mortgage. But the
remaining £1000 I cannot conceive a possibility of raising, but
by the mode of annuity which is I believe a very heavy disadvantage.
I own it was imprudent in me to make a clear
purchase at a time when I was sadly straitened, but if I had
missed the opportunity it never again would have occurred,
and I should have been vexed to see an ancient appanage,
a piece of, as it were, the flesh and blood of the family in the
hands of a stranger. And now that I have made the purchase
I should feel myself quite despicable should I give it
up. In this situation, then, my dear sir, would it not be
wise in me to accept 1000 guineas for my Life of Johnson,
supposing the person who made the offer should now stand to
it, which I fear may not be the case; for two volumes may be
considered as a disadvantageous circumstance. Could I indeed
raise £1000 upon the credit of the work, I should incline to
<i>game</i>, as Sir Joshua says, because it may produce double the
money, though Steevens <i>kindly</i> tells me that I have over printed,
and that the curiosity about Johnson is <i>now</i> only in our own
circle. Pray decide for me; and if, as I suppose, you are for
my taking the offer inform me with whom I am to treat.
In my present state of spirits I am all timidity. Your absence
has been a severe shake to me. I am at present quite at a loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
what to do.... I have now desired to have but one compositor.
Indeed, I go sluggishly and comfortlessly about my
work. As I pass your door I cast many a longing look....
We had a numerous club on Tuesday; I in the chair, quoting
Homer and Fielding, &amp;c. to the astonishment of Jo. Warton,
who with Langton and Seward eat a plain bit with me in my
new house last Saturday.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 10th February, Boswell informed Mr. Malone that he
had invested £16 8s. in a lottery ticket, and that instead of
obtaining £5000 had drawn a blank. He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Oh, could I but get a few thousands, what a difference
would it make upon my state of mind, which is harassed by
thinking of my debts! I am anxious to have your determination
as to my <i>magnum opus</i>. I am very unwilling to part with
the property of it, and certainly would not, if I could but get
credit for £1000 for three or four years. Could you not assist
me in that way, on the security of the book, and of an assignment
to one half of my rents, £700, which, upon my honour,
are always due, and would be forthcoming in the case of my
decease. I <i>will</i> not sell till I have your answer as to this.”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Malone did not reply. On the 25th Boswell made a
new proposal. After referring to a severe attack of melancholy
which had lately oppressed him, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am in a distressing perplexity how to decide as to the
property of my book. You must know that I am certainly
informed that a certain person, who delights in mischief, has
been depreciating it, so that I fear the sale of it may be very
dubious. <i>Two quartos</i> and <i>two guineas</i> sound in an alarming
manner. I believe in my present frame I should accept even
of £500, for I suspect that were I now to talk to Robinson, I
should find him not disposed to give £1000. Did he absolutely
offer it, or did he only express himself so as that you <i>concluded</i>
he would give it? The pressing circumstance is that I must
lay down £1000 by the 1st of May on account of the purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of land, which my old family enthusiasm urged me to make.
You, I doubt not, have full confidence in my honesty. May
I then ask you if you could venture to join with me in a bond
for that sum, as then I would take my chance, and as Sir
Joshua says, Game with my book? Upon my honour, your
telling me that you cannot comply with what I propose will
not in the least surprise me, or make any manner of difference
as to my opinion of your friendship. I mean to ask Sir Joshua
if he will join; for, indeed, I should be vexed to sell my
<i>magnum opus</i> for a great deal less than its intrinsic value. I
meant to publish on Shrove Tuesday, but if I can get out
within the month of March I shall be satisfied.”</p>

<p class="p1">Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr. Malone both declined pecuniary
responsibility, but Boswell was nevertheless relieved from his
embarrassments. He obtained in Scotland a loan of £600 on
the credit of his rents, and Dilly and Baldwin made an advance
on the credit of his book. Writing to Mr. Malone on the 8th
March, he excuses that gentleman’s unwillingness to incur
monetary risk, and elated in having overcome the pressure of
his creditors, he resolves to keep the property of his book,
“believing that he should not <i>repent</i> it.” There is a new
grievance:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You would observe,” he writes, “some stupid lines on Mr.
Burke in the ‘Oracle’ by <i>Mr. Boswell</i>. I instantly wrote to
Mr. Burke, expressing my indignation at such impertinence,
and had next morning a most obliging answer. Sir William
Scott told me I could have no legal redress. So I went <i>civilly</i>
to Bell, and he promised to mention <i>handsomely</i> that <i>James
Boswell</i>, Esq., was not the author of the lines. The note, however,
on the subject, was a second impertinence. But I can do
nothing. I wish Fox, in his bill upon libels, would make a
heavy penalty the consequence of forging any person’s name
to any composition, which in reality such a trick amounts to.”</p>

<p class="p1">Four days after conveying to Mr. Malone the tidings of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his deliverance from pecuniary troubles, Boswell condoles with
his friend, in his lottery ticket having drawn a blank, since had
a prize turned up, he would have expected the accommodation
of a loan! He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“As it is, I shall, as I wrote to you, be enabled to weather
my difficulties for some time; but I am still in great anxiety
about the sale of my book. I find so many people shake their
heads at the <i>two quartos</i> and <i>two guineas</i>. Courtenay is clear
that I should sound Robinson and accept of a thousand guineas,
if he will give that sum. Meantime, the title-page must be
made as good as may be. It appears to me that mentioning
his studies, works, conversations, and letters, is not sufficient;
and I would suggest comprehending an account, in chronological
order, of his studies, works, friendships, acquaintances,
and other particulars; his conversation with eminent men; a
series of his letters to various persons; also several original pieces
of his compositions never before published. The whole, &amp;c.
You will probably be able to assist me in expressing my idea
and arranging the parts. In the advertisement I intend to
mention the letter to Lord Chesterfield, and perhaps the
interview with the King, and the names of the correspondents,
in alphabetical order.... Do you know that my bad spirits
are returned upon me to a certain degree; and such is the
sickly fondness for change of place, and imagination of relief,
that I sometimes think you are happier by being in Dublin,
than one is in this great metropolis, where hardly any man
cares for another. I am persuaded I should relish your Irish
dinners very much. I have at length got chambers in the
Temple, in the very staircase where Johnson lived, and when
my <i>magnum opus</i> is fairly launched, then shall I make a trial.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his letter to Mr. Temple of the 2nd April, Boswell refers
to his forthcoming work in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My ‘Life of Johnson’ is at last drawing to a close. I am
correcting the last sheet.... I really hope to publish it on
the 25th current.... I am at present in such bad spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that I have every fear concerning it&mdash;that I may get no profit,
nay, may lose&mdash;that the public may be disappointed, and think
that I have done it poorly&mdash;that I may make many enemies,
and even have quarrels. But, perhaps, the very reverse of all
this may happen.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell adds in reference to his professional aspirations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“When my book is launched I shall, if I am alone and in
tolerable health and spirits, have some furniture put into my
chambers in the Temple, and force myself to sit there some
hours a day, and to attend regularly in Westminster Hall. The
chambers cost me £20 yearly, and I may reckon furniture and
a lad to attend them occasionally £20 more. I doubt whether
I shall get fees equal to the expense.”</p>

<p>On the 19th April, Boswell thus wrote to his friend Mr.
Dempster:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We must not entirely lose sight of one another, or rather,
we must not suffer ‘out of sight out of mind’ to be applicable to
two such old friends, who have always lived pleasantly together,
though of principles directly opposite.... I some time
ago resigned my Recordership of Carlisle. I perceived that no
advantage would accrue from it. I could satisfy you in <i>conversation</i>
that I was right. The melancholy event of losing my
valuable wife will, I fear, never allow me to have real comfort.
You cannot imagine how it hangs upon my spirits; yet I can
talk and write, and, in short, <i>force myself</i> to a wonderful degree.
I enclose you a poem which I have published upon a subject on
which I never heard your sentiments, but I could lay my life
you are one of the pretty theorists; however, you will have candour
enough to allow that I have <i>worked</i> well. I have a good
house in Great Portland Street. My two eldest daughters live
with me; my youngest is at a boarding-school at Chelsea; my
eldest son is at Eton; my second at Westminster. I am sadly
straitened in my circumstances; I can but <i>exist</i> as to <i>expense</i>;
but they are so good to me here that I have a full share of the
metropolitan advantages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">“My <i>magnum opus</i>, the ‘Life of Dr. Johnson,’ in two volumes,
quarto, is to be published on Monday, 16th May. It is too great
a book to be given in presents, as I gave my ‘Tour,’ so you must
not expect one, though you yourself form a part of its multifarious
contents. I really think it will be the most entertaining
collection that has appeared in this age. When it is fairly
launched, I mean to stick close to Westminster Hall, and it will
be truly kind if you recommend me appeals or causes of any
sort.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell’s poem on the Slave-trade, to which he refers, was
either at once withdrawn from circulation, or was, on his decease,
suppressed by his family. It is unknown to bibliographers.
The “Life of Johnson,” in two quarto volumes, was issued
about the middle of May from the publishing house of Mr.
Charles Dilly. The title-page, which the author had laboured
to render attractive, was thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D., comprehending an
Account of his Studies and numerous Works, in chronological
order; a series of his Epistolary Correspondence and Conversations
with many eminent persons; and various Original Pieces
of his composition, never before published. The whole exhibiting
a view of literature and literary men in Great Britain, for
more than half a century, during which he flourished, in two
volumes, by James Boswell, Esq. 2 vols., 4to. London: Printed
by Thomas Baldwin for Charles Dilly, in the Poultry, 1791.”</p>

<p class="p1">The following passages from the Dedication to Sir Joshua
Reynolds are characteristic of the writer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“If there be a pleasure in celebrating the distinguished merit
of a contemporary mixed with a certain degree of vanity not
altogether inexcusable in appearing fully sensible of it, where
can I find one in complimenting whom I can with more general
approbation gratify those feelings.” Referring to his Tour to
the Hebrides, the author proceeds: “In one respect this work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
will in some passages be different from the former. In my
‘Tour’ I was almost unboundedly open in my communications;
and from my eagerness to display the wonderful fertility and
readiness of Johnson’s wit, freely showed to the world its
dexterity even when I was myself the object of it. I trusted
that I should be liberally understood as knowing very well
what I was about, and by no means as simply unconscious of
the pointed effects of the satire. I own indeed that I was arrogant
enough to suppose that the tenor of the rest of the book
would sufficiently guard me against such a strange imputation.
But it seems I judged too well of the world; for, though I could
scarcely believe it, I have been undoubtedly informed that many
persons especially in distant quarters, not penetrating enough
into Johnson’s character, so as to understand his mode of
treating his friends, have arraigned my judgment instead of
seeing that I was sensible of all that they could observe. It is
related of the great Dr. Clarke that when, in one of his leisure
hours, he was unbending himself with a few friends in the most
playful and frolicksome manner, he observed Beau Nash approaching,
upon which he suddenly stopped. ‘My boys (said
he) let us be grave; here comes a fool.’ The world, my friend,
I have found to be a great fool, as to that particular on which
it has become necessary to speak very plainly. I have therefore
in this work been more reserved; and though I tell nothing but
the truth, I have still kept in my mind that the whole truth is
not always to be exposed. This, however, I have managed so
as to occasion no diminution of the pleasure which my book
should afford, though malignity may sometimes be disappointed
of its gratifications.”</p>

<p class="p1">In this manner Boswell disposes of Dr. Wolcott and the other
satirists who had made merry at his “Tour.” Though published
at the price of two guineas, the success of the “Life” was
immediate. It was eagerly sought after, and everywhere read.
Even those who were indifferent about Johnson, and who
despised his biographer, added the work to their library, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
were amused by its <i>chit chat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Writing to Mr. Temple on the
22nd August, Boswell reported that twelve hundred copies were
in circulation, and that he expected that the entire impression
of seventeen hundred copies would be sold before Christmas.
By the success of his work he was induced to cherish renovated
hope; he again dreamed of professional employment. In his
letter to Mr. Temple of the 22nd August he writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have gone the full round of the Home Circuit, to which I
have returned, finding it much more pleasant; and though I did
not get a single brief do not repent of the expense, as I am
showing myself desirous of business and imbibing legal knowledge.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 22nd November he informed Mr. Temple that he kept
chambers open in the Temple; and attended in Westminster
Hall; but had not the least prospect of business.</p>

<p>After attending Westminster Hall for two years Boswell was
employed in a case of appeal to the House of Peers. He had
no other brief. In the autumn of 1791 he resided several
weeks at Auchinleck. Returning to London in November he
thus reported himself to his friend at Mamhead:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I had a very unhappy time in Ayrshire. My house at
Auchinleck seemed deserted and melancholy; and it brought
upon my mind, with unusual force, the recollection of my having
lost my dear and valuable wife. My London spirits were soon
exhausted; I sank into languor and gloom; I found myself
very unfit to transact business with my tenants, or, indeed,
with anybody. To escape from what I felt at Auchinleck I
visited a good deal, but alas! I could not escape from myself:
in short, you may see that I was exceedingly ill. I hoped to
be restored when I got to London, but my depression of spirits
has continued, and still, though I go into jovial scenes, I feel
no pleasure in existence, except the mere gratification of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
senses. Oh, my friend, this is sad. I have imagined that
I was quite unable to write a letter.... My spirits have
been still more sunk by seeing Sir Joshua Reynolds almost as
low as myself. He has for more than two months past had
a pain in his blind eye, the effect of which has been to occasion
a weakness in the other, and he broods over the dismal apprehension
of becoming quite blind.... I force myself to be a
great deal with him, to do what is in my power to amuse
him.... This is a desponding, querulous letter, which
I have wished these several weeks to write. Pray try to do
me some good.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell’s correspondence with Mr. Temple in 1792 has, one
short note excepted, not been preserved. It is probable that
most of his spare hours were devoted to the revision of his
“Life of Johnson,” of which the second edition appeared in the
following year.</p>

<p>In October, 1792, the parish of Auchinleck became vacant by
the death of Mr. Dun. Though upholding as part of his <i>patriotic</i>
creed, that with negroes abroad the unlanded population at
home should be denied political or other privileges, Boswell
was not unwilling to obtain acceptance with the common people.
As patron of Auchinleck parish he assured the parishioners
that he would consult their wishes in planting the vacant
cure. On this subject he thus communicated with Mr. Temple
on the 26th February, 1793:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am within a few hours of setting out for Auchinleck,
honest David having secured me a place in the Carlisle coach
to Ferry Bridge that I may have an opportunity to stop should
I be too much fatigued. It is quite right that I should now go
down. The choice of a minister to a worthy parish is a matter
of very great importance, and I cannot be sure of the real
wishes of the people without being present. Only think,
Temple, how serious a duty I am about to discharge! I, James
Boswell, Esq.&mdash;you know what vanity that name includes&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
have promised to come down on purpose, and his honour’s
goodness is gratefully acknowledged. Besides, I have several
matters of consequence to my estate to adjust; and though the
journey will no doubt be uncomfortable, and my being alone in
that house where once I was so happy, be dreary in a woeful
degree, the consciousness of duty, and being busy, will I hope
support me. I shall write to you, my friend, from my seat.
I am to be there only about three weeks.”</p>

<p class="p1">Soon after his arrival in Ayrshire, Boswell presented to the
vacant living Mr. John Lindsay, a probationer from Edinburgh.
The appointment was not distasteful to the parishioners. Returning
to the metropolis he issued, in July, the second edition
of his “Life of Johnson,” in three octavo volumes; it contained
“eight sheets of additional matter,” and was improved otherwise.
In the <i>Advertisement</i> he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It seems to me in my moments of self-complacency, that
this extensive biographical work, however inferior in the nature,
may in one respect be assimilated to the ‘Odyssey.’ Amidst a
thousand entertaining and instructive episodes, the hero is never
long out of sight, for they are all in some degree connected with
him; and he, in the whole course of the history, is exhibited by
the author for the best advantage of his readers:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Quid virtus et quid sapientia possit,<br />
Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulyssem.’</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Should there be any cold-blooded or morose mortals who really
dislike this book I will give them a story to apply. When the
great Duke of Marlborough, accompanied by Lord Cadogan, was
one day reconnoitring the army in Flanders, a heavy rain came
on and they both called for their cloaks. Lord Cadogan’s
servant, a good-humoured, alert lad, brought his lordship’s in a
minute; the Duke’s servant, a lazy, sulky dog, was so sluggish
that his Grace, being wet to the skin, reproved him, and had for
an answer, with a grunt, ‘I came as fast as I could;’ upon
which the Duke calmly said, ‘Cadogan! I would not for a
thousand pounds have that fellow’s temper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>’”</p>

<p class="pbq">“There are some men I believe, who have, or think they have,
a very small share of vanity. Such may speak of their literary
fame in a decorous style of diffidence; but I confess that I am
so formed by nature and by habit that to restrain the expression
of delight on having obtained such fame, to me would be truly
painful. Why, then, should I suppress it? Why, out of the
‘abundance of the heart,’ should I not speak? Let me then
mention, with a warm but no insolent exultation, that I have
been regaled with spontaneous praise of my work by many and
various persons eminent for their rank, learning, talents, and
accomplishments, much of which praise I leave under their
hands to be reposited in my archives at Auchinleck. An
honourable and reverend friend, speaking of the favourable
reception of my volume, even in the circles of fashion and
elegance, said to me, ‘You have made them all talk Johnson.’
Yes, I may add, I have <i>Johnsonized</i> the land; and I trust they
will not only talk, but think Johnson.”</p>

<p class="p1">No sooner was the second edition of his work on the publisher’s
shelves than Boswell was again involved in the meshes
of dissipation. Sauntering forth, quite drunk, he was knocked
down and robbed. Some weeks after the event he communicated
with Mr. Temple as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Behold my hand! The robbery is only of a few shillings,
but the cut on my head and bruises on my arms were sad things,
and confined me to my bed in pain and fever and helplessness,
as a child many days. By means of surgeon Earle and apothecary
Devaynes, I am now, I thank God, pretty well. This,
however, shall be a crisis in my life. I trust I shall henceforth
be a sober, regular man. Indeed, my indulgence in wine has, of
late years especially, been excessive. You remember what Lord
Eliot said, nay, what you, I am sorry to think, have seen. Your
suggestion as to my being carried off in a state of intoxication
is awful. I thank you for it, my dear friend. It impressed me
much, I assure you.”</p>

<p class="p1">In a letter to Mr. Temple, dated 31st May, 1794, Boswell
again expresses his appreciation of his friend’s remonstrances:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I thank you sincerely for your friendly admonition on my
frailty in indulging so much in wine. I do resolve anew to be
upon my guard, as I am sensible how very pernicious as well
as disreputable such a habit is. How miserably have I yielded
to it in various years. Recollect what General Paoli said to
you&mdash;recollect what happened to Berwick.”</p>

<p class="p1">A constitution naturally robust had been severely taxed.
Boswell imbibed liquor of all sorts, and like other dissipated
persons, fell into bouts of drinking. When he partially
abstained, he unconsciously prepared himself for inebriate
practices of a more aggravated character. At length he became
a victim to these social excesses. Early in the spring of 1795,
Mr. Temple, junior, then an inmate of Boswell’s house, wrote to
his father: “A few nights ago Mr. Boswell returned from the
Literary Club quite weak and languid.” Such is our first intimation
of an illness, which terminated fatally. About the
beginning of April he commenced a letter to Mr. Temple in
these words:&mdash;“My dear Temple,&mdash;I would fain write to you
in my own hand, but really cannot.” Boswell dropped the pen,
which was taken up by his son James, who thus wrote to his
dictation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Alas, my friend, what a state is this! My son James is to
write for me what remains of this letter, and I am to dictate.
The pain which continued for so many weeks was very severe
indeed, and when it went off I thought myself quite well; but
I soon felt a conviction that I was by no means as I should be&mdash;so
exceedingly weak, as my miserable attempt to write to you
affords a full proof. All, then, that can be said is, that I must
wait with patience.”</p>

<p class="p1">After referring to Mr. Temple’s own indisposition, Boswell
concludes by representing himself as “a good deal stronger,”
and subscribing himself “here and hereafter” his correspondent’s
“affectionate friend.” A postscript, added by James Boswell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
jun., informed Mr. Temple that his father was ignorant of his
“dangerous situation.” The letter was kept up, and another
addition, dated 8th April, represented the patient as “in a state
of extraordinary pain and weakness,” but as “having a good
deal recovered.”</p>

<p>The improvement was temporary. After a few days Boswell
suffered a relapse. On the 17th April, his younger son wrote to
Mr. Temple as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“My father desires me to tell you that on Tuesday evening
he was taken ill with a fever, attended with a severe shivering
and violent headache, disorder in his stomach and throwing up;
he has been close confined to bed ever since. He thinks himself
better to-day, but cannot conjecture when he shall recover. His
affection for you remains the same. You will receive a long and
full letter from him.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the 4th of May, David Boswell communicated to Mr.
Temple that his brother was in “the most imminent danger.”
On the 18th of the same month, James Boswell, jun., reported
that his father was “considerably worse,” and that there were
“little or no hopes of his recovery.” Next day David Boswell
reported to Mr. Temple that the end had come:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have now,” he writes, “the painful task of informing you
that my dear brother expired this morning at two o’clock: we
have both lost a kind and affectionate friend, and I shall never
have such another. He has suffered a great deal during his illness,
which has lasted five weeks, but not much in his last
moments.”</p>

<p class="p1">Boswell died in his house in Great Portland Street, on the
19th May, 1795. He had reached his fifty-fifth year. In the
June number of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> his friends, Messrs.
Courtenay and Malone, presented estimates of his character.
Mr. Courtenay wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Good nature was highly predominant in his character. He
appeared to entertain sentiments of benevolence to all mankind,
and it does not seem to me that he ever did or could injure any
human being <i>intentionally</i>. His conversational talents were
always pleasing and often fascinating. He was a Johnson in
everything but <i>manner</i>; and there were few of Dr. Johnson’s
friends that were not very ready to dispense with <i>that</i>. His
attachment to the Doctor for so long a period was a meritorious
perseverance in the desire of knowledge.” Admitting that his
social habits had shortened his life, Mr. Courtenay adds,&mdash;“As
his belief in Revelation was unshaken, and his religious
impressions were deep and recurring frequently, let us hope
that he has now attained that state from which imperfection
and calamity are alike excluded.”</p>

<p class="p1">From the misrepresentations of a journalist Mr. Malone
vindicated the memory of his friend in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The most important misrepresentation is that Mr. Boswell
was convivial without being <i>social</i> or <i>friendly</i>,&mdash;a falsehood which
all who knew him intimately can peremptorily contradict. He
had not only an inexhaustible fund of good humour and good
nature, but was extremely warm in his attachments, and as ready
to exert himself for his friends as any man.” After claiming for
Boswell “considerable intellectual powers,” he concludes,&mdash;“He
will long be regretted by a wide circle of friends, to whom his
good qualities and social talents always made his company a
valuable accession; and by none more sincerely than by the
present vindicator of his fame.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the same number of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, a correspondent,
subscribing himself “M. Green,” states that Boswell
contemplated the publication of a quarto volume, to be embellished
with plates on the controversy occasioned by the
<i>Beggar’s Opera</i>. “With this particular view,” he adds, “he
lately paid several visits to the present truly humane ‘governor
of Newgate,’ as he ordinarily styled Mr. Kirby.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent number of the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Mr. Temple, under the signature of “Biographicus,” denied a
statement by Mr. Malone that Boswell was of a melancholy temperament;
he maintained that he was quite otherwise prior to
his attachment to Dr. Johnson. J. B. R., another writer in the
same magazine, remarked that the deceased “had many failings
and many virtues and many amiable qualities, which predominated
over the frailties incident to human nature.”</p>

<p>Boswell’s Will, written with his own hand, and bearing date
28th May, 1785, was found in his repositories. It is now
printed for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Had it earlier been made public the
testator might have encountered “less obloquy,” and obtained
greater praise. Seldom has Scottish landlord evinced greater
consideration for his tenantry and domestics. The document is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I James Boswell Esquire of Auchinleck having already
settled everything concerning my Landed Estate so far as is
in my power as an heir of Entail, so that my mind is quiet
respecting my dear wife and children, do now when in perfect
soundness of mind but under the apprehension of some danger
to my life which however may prove a false alarm, thus make
my last Will and Testament containing also clauses of another
nature which I desire may be valid and effectual. I resign my
soul to God my almighty and most merciful Father trusting
that it will be redeemed by the awfull and mysterious Sacrifice
of our Lord Jesus Christ and admitted to endless felicity in
heaven. I request that my body may be interred in the family
burial place in the church of Auchinleck. I appoint my much
valued spouse Mrs. Margaret Montgomerie and my worthy
friend Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, Baronet, to be my Executors
and in case of the death of either of them the office shall
devolve solely to the survivor. And whereas my honoured and
pious grand mother Lady Elizabeth Boswell devised to the heir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
succeeding to the barrony of Auchinleck from generation to
generation the Ebony Cabinet and the dressing plate of silver
gilt, which belonged to her mother Veronica, Countess of Kincardine,
leaving it however optional to her son my father that
entail thereof or not as he should think fit, and he having
neglected to do so, whereby the said Ebony Cabinet and dressing
plate are now at my free disposal, I do by these presents dispose
the same to the heir succeeding to the barrony of Auchinleck
from generation to generation. And I declare that it shall
not be in the power of any such heir to alienate or impignorate
the same on any account whatever. And I do hereby dispose to
the said heirs of Entail in their order, all lands and heritages
belonging to me, in fee simple, after payment of my debts, but
under this provision, that in case any of them shall alienate the
said Ebony Cabinet and dressing plate, the person so alienating
shall forfeit the sum of One Thousand Pounds sterling, which
shall be paid to the next heir succeeding by entail. And I
declare that the heir of Entail first succeeding to these my
unentailed lands, shall within six months after his succession
thereto execute a deed of Entail thereof to the same series
of heirs with that in the Entail executed by my Father and me,
which if he fails to do they shall then go to the next heir
of Entail, and it is also an express condition that he shall
divest himself of the field thereof and reserve only his life-rent.
I mean this to apply to the said first succeeding heir. Furthermore
as my late honoured Father made a very curious collection
of the classics and other books, which it is desireable
should be preserved for ever in the family of Auchinleck,
I do by these presents dispose to the successive heirs of
Entail of the barrony of Auchinleck” [here there is a word
torn off] “Greek and Latin books, as also all manuscripts
of whatever kind, lying in the house of Auchinleck,
under the same conditions and under the same forfeiture
as I have mentioned with regard to the Ebony Cabinet
and dressing plate, and all my other moveable Estate or
Executory I leave equally among my other children, the furniture
in the house of Auchinleck to be valued by two sworn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
appreazers, and the heir to keep it at that value and pay the
same to my younger children, excepting however all my
pictures which I dispose to the said successive heirs of Entail
under the same conditions and forfeiture as above mentioned,
and excepting also the furniture in my house at Edinburgh
which I bequeath to my dear wife. I bequeath one hundred
pounds sterling to my dear brother Thomas David Boswell
Esquire banker in London, to purchase a piece of plate to keep
in remembrance of me in his family and to my dear brother
Lieutenant John Boswell being a batchelor, I bequeath Fifty
Guineas to purchase a ring or whatever other thing he may
like best to keep for my sake. To my friends the Reverend
Mr. Temple in Cornwall, John Johnston Esquire of Grange,
Sir John Dick Baronet, Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo,
Baronet, Captain John Macbryde of the Royal Navy, and Mr.
Charles Dilly of London, bookseller, Alexander Fairlie of
Fairlie, Esq. and Edmund Malone Esq. of the kingdom
of Ireland, The Hon. Colonel James Stewart and George
Dempster Esquire, I bequeath each a gold mourning ring, and
I hereby leave to the said Sir William Forbes, the Reverend
Mr. Temple and Edmund Malone Esquire all my manuscripts
of my own composition, and all my letters from various persons
to be published for the benefit of my younger children, as they
shall decide, that is to say they are to have a discretionary power
to publish more or less. I leave to Mr. James Bruce my overseer
Twenty Pounds yearly during his life and if he shall
continue to reside at Auchinleck I leave to him the house he
now possesses with his meal and all other perquisites. And to
Mrs. Bell Bruce my housekeeper I leave Ten pounds yearly
during her life with two pecks of meal weekly in case of her
not liveing in the family of Auchinleck. Lastly, as there are
upon the estate of Auchinleck several tenants whose families
have possessed their farms for many generations, I do by these
presents grant leases for nineteen years and their respective
lifetimes of their present farms to John Templeton in Hopland,
James Murdoch in Blackstown commonly called the Raw,
James Peden in Old Byre, William Samson in Mill of Auchinleck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
John Hird in Hirdstown, William Murdoch in Willocks
town, and to any of the sons of the late James Caldow in Stivenstown
whom the ministers and elders of Auchinleck shall
approve of, a lease of that farm in the above terms, the rents to
be fixed by two men to be mutually chosen by the laird of
Auchinleck for the time and each tenant. I also grant a lease in
the like terms to Andrew Dalrymple in Mains of Auchinleck,
my Baron officer. And I do beseech all the succeeding heirs of
Entail to be kind to the Tenants and not to turn out old possessors
to get a little more rent. And in case my nomination of
Tutors and Curators to my children being written upon
unstamped paper should not be valid, I here again constitute
and appoint my dear wife, Mrs. Margaret Montgomerie and my
worthy friend Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, or the survivor of
them, to the said office with all usual powers and with the
recommendations contained in the said unstamped deed. In
witness whereof, these presents written with my own hand (of
which I consent to the registration in the books of Council and
Session that they may have full effect and thereto constitute
my procurators) are subscribed by me at London this twenty
eight day of May, One thousand Seven hundred and Eighty five,
before these witnesses Mr. Edward Dilly bookseller there, and
Mr. John Normaville his clerk. (signed) James Boswell. Chs.
Dilly witness, John Normaville witness.”</p>

<p class="p1">The three persons nominated as literary executors did not
meet, and the entire business of the trust was administered by
Sir William Forbes, Bart., who appointed as his law agent
Robert Boswell, writer to the signet, cousin german of the
deceased. By that gentleman’s advice, Boswell’s manuscripts
were left to the disposal of his family; and it is believed
that the whole were immediately destroyed. The <i>Commonplace
Book</i> escaped, having been incidentally sold among the printed
books.</p>

<p>The following inventory of Boswell’s moveable effects, presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for registration in the Commissariat Register is not
without interest:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the first place there pertained and belonged to the said
defunct at the time aforesaid of his death, the articles aftermentioned
of the values underwritten, whereof the Executor
herein gives up in inventary the sum of Twenty Shillings
sterling of the value of each article viz., Imprimis Four hundred
and eighty three pounds fourteen shillings as the amount of

in London. Item, Five hundred and Seventy six pounds eight
shillings and two pence as the value of furniture in the house
of Auchinleck estimated by two sworn appraisers. Item, One
hundred and five pounds as the value of silver plate at

Greek and Latin classics and manuscripts there, also left to
the heir. Item, Seventy seven pounds three shillings as the

the hands of the Executor. Item, Three hundred pounds as
the value of the remaining copies of the Life of D<sup>r.</sup> Johnson

And One hundred pounds as the supposed value of manuscripts
left by the defunct.</p>

<p class="pbq">“In the second place there was indebted and owing to the
said defunct at the time aforesaid of his death, the sums of
money after mentioned for the reasons after specified, viz., One
Pound sterling part of the sum of Ninety Seven Pounds eight
shillings and Eleven pence sterling being a balance of cash in
the hands of Mr Thomas David Boswell brother to the defunct

one pounds sixteen shillings and six pence being a claim Mr
Alexander Boswell the heir for cash advanced to him by Mr
Thomas David Boswell at the time of the defunct’s death and
credited to Mr Thomas David Boswell in his account with the
Executor. Item, One pound Sterling part of the sum of Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>

pence as arrears of rent of the estate of Auchinleck for
accounts transmitted by the factor. Item, One pound sterling
part of the sum of Nine hundred and forty two pounds six
shillings and seven pence sterling as the claim against the heirs

sum of forty two pounds nine shillings and one penny being a
balance of account due by Mr Dilly, bookseller. Item, One
pound sterling, part of the sum of six hundred and eighty four
pounds sixteen shillings and eight pence being debt due by
Capt<sup>n</sup> Bruce Boswell of Calcutta of Principal and Interest paid
to the Executor since the defunct’s death. Item, One pound
sterling, part of the sum of one hundred and ninety five
pounds sterling being a balance of debt due by the Trustees
of the late Mr Johnston of Grange, as stated by the defunct

first day of January Seventeen hundred and ninety five. And
One pound sterling, part of the sum of seven hundred pounds
sterling and upwards of debts due from various turnpike roads
in Ayrshire for money advanced by the late Lord Auchinleck.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the terms of his Will, Boswell’s remains were conveyed to
Auchinleck, and there deposited in the family vault. Robert
Boswell proposed that a memorial tablet should be placed at his
grave and offered the following metrical inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Here Boswell lies! drop o’er his tomb a tear,<br />
Let no malignant tongue pursue him here;<br />
Bury his failings in the silent grave,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>And from unfriendly hands his memory save.<br />
Record the praise he purchased, let his name<br />
Mount on the wings of literary fame,<br />
And to his honour say,&mdash;‘Here Boswell lies,<br />
Whose pleasing pen adorned the good and wise,<br />
Whose memory down the stream of time shall flow<br />
Far as famed Johnson’s or Paoli’s go!’”</p>

<p class="p1">Robert Boswell’s proposal was not entertained, and the
preceding epitaph was found among his papers after his own
decease many years subsequently. By his descendants the
memory of Johnson’s biographer has not been honoured, yet the
family of Boswell, with a pedigree dating from the Conquest,
cannot point to a more distinguished kinsman.</p>

<p>The marriage of persons nearly related by blood is apt to
engender cerebral weakness in the offspring. The first-born of
cousins-german, James Boswell suffered from an imperfect and
morbid organization. Mr. Carlyle’s analysis of his mental condition
we cordially accept, “The highest [quality],” writes Mr. Carlyle,
“lay side by side with the lowest, not morally combined with
it and spiritually transfiguring it, but tumbling in half-mechanical
juxtaposition with it; and from time to time, as the mad
alternative chanced, irradiating it, or eclipsed by it.” Around
his intellectual nature hovered a dark cloud, while there was
light within; the cloud was malformation or disease, but the
morbid element did not extinguish the internal fire. Boswell’s
perceptive power was of the highest order; he could retain
and reproduce scenes and conversations with the naturalness
of reality. A literary Pre-Raffaelite, his observation was acute
in proportion as his reflective powers waned or slept; what he
saw and heard he set forth forcibly and without embellishment.
The assertion of Lord Macaulay that the “Life of Johnson”
was due to the author’s weakness requires no serious refutation.
Boswell produced the best biography in the language, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he was the best fitted for the task. Like the astronomer who
points his telescope to the heavens in a darkened room, he
concentrated his mental energies on the objects of his reverence,
and with photographic accuracy depicted all that he surveyed.
In proportion as he failed to develop his own intellectual
nature, he succeeded in delineating the intellectual character of
others. A mirror true and transparent lay under the opaque
cloud, and reflected outward what a healthier intellect had
appropriated and transfused. If in respect of mental phenomena
the figure is admissible&mdash;the reflective faculty which is
ordinarily concave and thereby receptive, was in the mind of
Boswell convex and radiating outwards. The cords which
fettered his understanding braced his perception and nerved his
memory. He showed strength in weakness. The dry rod
budded. The grey ruin was mantled by the green ivy.</p>

<p>The fool prates unconscious of his folly; the maniac is
happy in his chain. Boswell was conscious of his weakness,&mdash;hence
his habitual melancholy. To Mr. Temple he early
spoke of madness existing in his family, and afterwards
described himself as partially insane. In his journal he
compares his head to a tavern usurped by low punch drinkers,
whom he could not displace. Such an unhappy consciousness
might have led to reckless perversity, or hopeless inaptitude.
In Boswell it stimulated to untiring effort, life-long energy.
His vanity and vacillation and rashness were attendant on a
distempered brain&mdash;his literary achievements were the result of
a successful conflict with constitutional disorder.</p>

<p>Boswell lived at a period when social excesses, especially in
North Britain, prevailed greatly. Into these excesses he fell,
but he freely acknowledged his errors, and sincerely repented.
Ambitious of personal honour, he nevertheless promoted sedulously
the interests of others. A fervid patriot, he was an obliging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
neighbour, a generous companion, and an unfailing friend. He
exercised an abundant hospitality. Angry at times he was
easily reconciled, and hastened to forgive. His religious views,
long unfixed, were never wholly obscured; he passed through
the ordeals of credulity and scepticism, and at length returning
to his old moorings, determined to know nothing but a Saviour
crucified. In his Will, prepared within the retirement of his
closet, he made this record of his trust,&mdash;“I resign my soul to
God, my almighty and most merciful Father, trusting that it
will be redeemed by the awful and mysterious sacrifice of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and admitted to eternal felicity in heaven.”
Dr. Johnson, who knew his weaknesses, commended his piety,
and Sir William Forbes, another enlightened judge of human
character, has borne concerning him this testimony:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I have known few men who possessed a stronger sense of
piety, or more fervent devotion (tinctured no doubt with some
little share of superstition, which had probably been in some
degree fostered by his habits of intimacy with Dr. Johnson),
perhaps not always sufficient to regulate his imagination or
direct his conduct, yet still genuine, and founded both in his
understanding and his heart.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Of Boswell’s personal aspects, the full length portrait by Langton,
engraved for this volume, is understood to convey a correct
representation. Rather above the middle height, and inclined to
corpulency, he walked with a stately gait, and in his costume
observed the latest fashion. He had a large head, and wore a
powdered wig; his prominent but well set features beamed with
perpetual good humour. “It was impossible,” remarked a
contemporary, “to look in his face without being moved by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
comicality which always reigned upon it.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> He talked much
and with rapidity, but his observant faculty was not apparent
to those who only met him in society.</p>

<p>Boswell left two sons and three daughters; James, the younger
son, entered Brazenose College, Oxford, of which he was elected
a fellow upon the Vinerian foundation. He was afterwards
called to the English Bar, and became a Commissioner of
Bankruptcy. An accomplished scholar and of industrious
habits, he was by Mr. Malone appointed his literary executor.
Under his care appeared Mr. Malone’s enlarged edition of
Shakespeare, completed in 1821, in twenty-one octavo volumes.
In the first volume he defended, in an able and ingenious essay,
Mr. Malone’s reputation from an attack made on his statements
and opinions by a writer of eminence. He inherited his father’s
<i>bonhommie</i> and love of sociality. He died unmarried in the
Middle Temple, London, on the 24th February, 1822, aged forty-three;
his remains were deposited in the Temple Church. By
his elder brother his death was lamented in these lines,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There is a pang when kindred spirits part,</p>
<p class="pp7">And cold philosophy we must disown;</p>
<p class="pp6">There is a thrilling spot in every heart,</p>
<p class="pp7">For pulses beat not from a heart of stone.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Boswell, th’ allotted earth has closed on thee,</p>
<p class="pp7">Thy mild but generous warmth has passed away:</p>
<p class="pp6">A finer spirit never death set free,</p>
<p class="pp7">And now the friend we honour’d is but clay.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“His was the triumph of the heart and mind,</p>
<p class="pp7">His was the lot which few are blessed to know:</p>
<p class="pp6">More proved, more valued&mdash;fervent, yet so kind,</p>
<p class="pp7">He never lost one friend, nor found one foe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Alexander Boswell, the biographer’s elder son, succeeded to
the family estate. He studied at Westminster School, and the
University of Oxford; and, after making the tour of Europe
settled at Auchinleck. A lover of historical and antiquarian
learning, he established a private printing-press, and reproduced
many rare tracts preserved in the family library. Early devoted
to poetical composition, he published several volumes of poetry
and song. His poems abound in drollery, but are generally
fragmentary. Of his songs, “Jenny’s Bawbee,” “Jenny
Dang the Weaver,” “The Lass o’ Isla,” and “Bannocks o’ Barley
Meal,” have long been popular. To public affairs he devoted
no inconsiderable attention. He was in the Conservative interest
elected M.P. for Ayrshire, and became Colonel of the Yeomanry
Cavalry, in the same county. He originated the proposal of
erecting a public monument to the poet Burns, on the banks of
the Doon, and raised £2,000 on behalf of the undertaking. In
1821 his patriotism and public enterprise were rewarded by a
Baronetcy. His career terminated under painful circumstances.
Indulging a tendency to sarcasm, he published in a Glasgow
newspaper a severe pasquinade against Mr. James Stuart, younger
of Dunearn, a leader of the liberal party at Edinburgh. Challenged
by Mr. Stuart to mortal combat, he accepted the <i>cartel</i>, and
the parties met at Auchtertool, Fifeshire. Sir Alexander fell,
the bullet from his opponent’s pistol having entered the middle
of the right clavicle, which it severely fractured. He lingered till
the following day. His death took place on the 27th March, 1822,
and his remains were interred at Auchinleck. In the following
verses, John Goldie, an Ayrshire poet, celebrated his obsequies:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“O! heard you the trumpet sound sad on the gale,<br />
O! heard you the voice of weeping and wail?<br />
O! saw you the horsemen in gallant array,<br />
As in sorrow and silence they moved on their way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The people’s deep wailing, the trumpet’s shrill tone,<br />
Were the breathings of sorrow for him that is gone;<br />
And yon dark plumes of death that did mournfully wave,<br />
Deck’d the bier that bore on their lov’d chief to the grave.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“When the train of lone mourners arrived at the path,<br />
That leads to the desolate mansions of death,<br />
O! marked you each horseman lean sad on his sword,<br />
When the corse slowly passed of the chief he adored.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And mark’d you each manly heart heave with a sigh;<br />
And mark’d you the tear-drop that gush’d in each eye<br />
Of those who were robed in the garments of woe,<br />
When they saw him in Death’s dreary mansion laid low.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Thy halls, Auchinleck! are all desolate now,<br />
Aye! roll on in sorrow, in solitude flow;<br />
For low lies thy bard who so sweetly did sing,&mdash;<br />
Thy chieftain so true to his country and king.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Sir Alexander married in November, 1799, Grace, fifth
daughter of Thomas Cumming, banker, Edinburgh, representative
of the ancient family of Erenside. By this marriage
he became father of one son and three daughters. Grace
Theresa, the eldest daughter, married Sir William Francis Eliott,
Bart., of Stobs, and became mother of the present baronet,
with other issue. Grace Jane died in childhood, and Margaret
Emily, the youngest daughter, is wife of Major-General Vassall,
and resides at Balhary, Perthshire. James, only son of Sir
Alexander Boswell, was born in December, 1806. He studied
at Brazenose College, Oxford, and after succeeding to Auchinleck
resided chiefly on his estate. In 1830 he espoused
his cousin, Jessie Jane, elder daughter of Sir James Montgomery
Cunningham, Bart., of Corsehill; of which marriage were born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
two daughters. In 1850, Sir James Boswell instituted a legal
process to prove the invalidity of the Auchinleck entail. He
was opposed by Thomas Alexander Boswell, of Crawley Grange,
next heir-male, but it was held by the judges that as the material
word “irredeemably” was written upon an erasure, the entail
was inoperative.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Relieved from the settlement of 1776, Sir
James Boswell bequeathed Auchinleck to his two daughters as
co-heiresses. Sir James died in 1857 when the baronetcy
became extinct. Julia, his elder daughter, married George
Mounsey, solicitor, Carlisle, some time mayor of that city.
Emily Harriet, the younger daughter, married in 1873, the Hon.
Richard Wogan Talbot, eldest son of Lord Talbot de Malahide.</p>

<p>The biographer’s three daughters were Veronica, Euphemia,
and Elizabeth. Veronica, the eldest, survived her father only
four months; she died of consumption on the 26th September,
1795, aged twenty-three. Euphemia, the second daughter,
inherited her father’s literary tastes, combined, unhappily,
with cerebral weakness. Leaving the protection of her
family she fixed her abode in London, resolved on supporting
herself as an operatic writer. She composed an Opera for
Drury Lane Theatre, which, according to her narrative, was
accepted by the manager, and was being prepared for the
stage, when the theatre was in 1809 destroyed by fire. Thereafter,
she made eleemosynary appeals by private letters and
public advertisements. She entreated pecuniary aid from
the Lord Chancellor Eldon, the Earl of Moira, Lord Lonsdale,
and Lord Sidmouth. On the death of the Princess Amelia, in
1810, she composed a “Soliloquy,” which she forwarded to the
Prince Regent, in the belief that she would be rewarded by a
pension on the Civil List. From private lodgings in Northumberland
street she in 1811 despatched a missive, setting forth that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
being “neglected by those bound by the ties of blood to cherish
her,” she had “pledged her pianoforte,&mdash;though a composer is as
much at a loss for an instrument as a carpenter without his
tools.” In another letter of the same year she writes, “If
dragged to a jail, which must be my fate, I shudder at it, and
implore your aid.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Let me not suffer Otway’s fate,<br />
When Nelly’s<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> tears were sent too late:<br />
Where Genius pierced through darkest gloom,<br />
Though hungry Death has marked his tomb.”</p>

<p class="p1">The charge of neglect preferred against her relatives by this
unhappy gentlewoman having obtained some credit, we have
instituted on the subject a careful inquiry. Euphemia Boswell,
we find, was the victim of a diseased imagination. By her
relatives she was regarded with affectionate solicitude, while they
severely suffered from her painful hallucinations and groundless
complaints. She died about the age of sixty. In her Will she
expressed a desire that her remains should be deposited in Westminster,
Abbey near the grave of Dr. Johnson. She was buried
elsewhere. She composed a small work which she dedicated to
Bishop Porteous; no copy has been found.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, the biographer’s youngest daughter, married 23rd
December, 1799, her second cousin, William Boswell, advocate,
who became Sheriff of Berwickshire. Of this marriage were
born three sons and one daughter. Robert Cramond, the eldest
son, died in 1821, shortly after being admitted advocate. James
Paoli, second son, joined the army, and died in India in 1820;
Bruce, the third son, also joined the army, and attained the rank
of Colonel. The daughter, Elizabeth Margaret Montgomery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
married November, 1849, John Williams, of H.E.I.C’s. Civil
Service, Bombay, who died in 1853. Mrs. Elizabeth Boswell

the death of Thomas Alexander Boswell, son of the biographer’s
brother, Thomas David, in March, 1852,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the fine estates of
Crawley Grange, Buckinghamshire,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and Astwood, Berkshire,
together worth nearly £2,000 per annum, became possessed by
Colonel Bruce Boswell, who dying in October, 1856, was succeeded
by his sister, who survives. Mrs. Williams was mother
of twin sons, who died in infancy; her only surviving child,
Elizabeth Anne, was married in 1860 to the Rev. Charles
Cumberlye, who assumed the name of Ware on the death
of his grand-uncle, Mr. Samuel Ware. Mr. Cumberlye Ware
died in May, 1870, and his widow in March, 1871. Their family
consist of one son and three daughters. The son, Charles Edward
Ware, is precluded by a family settlement from succeeding to
the maternal property, and the heiress of Crawley Grange is
Edith Caroline, his eldest sister, who, on succession, will
assume the name of Boswell. The two younger daughters,
Elizabeth Mary and Catherine Augusta, retain the family name
of Cumberlye.</p>

<p>William Boswell, Advocate and Sheriff of Berwickshire, who
married the youngest daughter of the biographer, was eldest of
four sons of Robert Boswell, the biographer’s cousin-german,
and law agent under his will. This gentleman was born at
Auchinleck House, on the 19th January, 1740; his father was
Dr. John Boswell, younger brother of Lord Auchinleck, and his
mother, Anne, daughter of Robert Cramond, of Auldbar, Forfarshire.
Robert Boswell was a writer to the signet, in Edinburgh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
he subsequently held office as Lyon Depute, and latterly removed
to London. Possessed of literary tastes and unflagging industry,
he qualified himself to read the Scriptures in the original tongues.
He composed hymns, some of which were after his decease
printed for private circulation. His metrical epitaph on his
cousin, the biographer, has been quoted. Eminently pious,
he exhorted publicly. He died at London in April, 1804,
in his 65th year.</p>

<p>Alexander Boswell, writer to the Signet, second son of
Robert Boswell, was father of the Rev. Robert Bruce Boswell,
chaplain to the Honourable East India Company and minister
of St. James’s church, Calcutta.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The son of that reverend
gentleman, John Alexander Corrie Boswell, held an appointment
in the Honourable East India Company’s Madras Civil
Service; he died some years ago. His son, Henry St. George
Boswell, now resident in London, is male representative of the
house of Boswell of Auchinleck. John James, third son of
Robert Boswell, was admitted advocate, but afterwards became
a physician, and entered the medical service of the Honourable
East India Company; he latterly sought practice in Edinburgh,
where he died in August, 1839. Major John James Boswell,
his only surviving son, commands the 2nd Regiment of Punjaub
Infantry, at Dera Ghazee Khan, in India. John Campbell,
fourth son of Robert Boswell, was a physician in India; he
died at Penang, <i>s. p.</i> in October, 1841. Miss Charlotte Maria
Tucker, granddaughter of Robert Boswell, is under her <i>nom de
plume</i>, A. L. O. E., well known for her valuable contributions to
religious literature.</p>

<p>Concerning James Boswell’s maternal ancestors, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
particulars may be acceptable. Charles Erskine, of Alva,
son of the Hon. Charles Erskine, fifth son of John, seventh
Earl of Mar, was created a baronet of Nova Scotia on the
30th April, 1666. Charles, his third son, was a lord of
session, with the judicial designation of Lord Tinwald, and
was father of James Erskine, a lord of session, by the title
of Lord Alva. Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Erskine, Bart.,
grandson of the first baronet, was many years M.P. for the
Anstruther burghs; he composed the popular song, “The
Garb of Old Gaul.” He died in 1765, and was succeeded in
the baronetcy by James, his eldest son, who assumed the
surname of St. Clair, and on the death of his uncle, Alexander
Wedderburn, first Earl of Rosslyn in 1805, became the second
Earl.</p>

<p>Colonel John Erskine, a younger son of the Hon. Sir
Charles Erskine, first baronet of Alva, and brother of Lord
Tinwald, married Euphemia, daughter of William Cochrane, of
Ochiltree, of the noble house of Dundonald, and his wife Lady
Mary Bruce, eldest daughter of the second Earl of Kincardine.
Two daughters of this marriage became memorable. Euphemia,
the younger, was the first wife of Lord Auchinleck, and mother
of James Boswell, who by maternal descent was great-great-grandson
of John, seventh Earl of Mar.</p>

<p>Mary, eldest daughter of Colonel John Erskine, married in
1739 the Rev. Alexander Webster, D.D., minister of the Tolbooth
Church, Edinburgh. Connected with this marriage is a
romantic incident. Prior to his settlement at Edinburgh Dr.
Webster was minister of Culross, Perthshire. Mary Erskine
resided in that parish with her aunt Lady Preston, wife of
Sir George Preston, Bart., of Valleyfield. A young gentleman
of the neighbourhood was attracted by her charms, but being
unsuccessful in his addresses, begged Dr. Webster to intercede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on his behalf. The Doctor consented, and waiting on Miss
Erskine, pled his friend’s cause with energy. The lady listened
patiently but expressed a decided negative. “Had you spoken
as well for yourself,” she added, “I might have answered
differently.” To his friend Dr. Webster reported the particulars
of the interview, and soon afterwards presented himself
at Valleyfield to plead his own suit. The lady complied,
but her relations consented with reluctance. The marriage took
place on the 13th June, 1737; Miss Erskine possessing a dowry
of £4,000. Elated by his good fortune Dr. Webster celebrated
his helpmate in a song, which, published in the <i>Scots Magazine</i>
for November, 1747, became popular. It commenced thus,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“O how could I venture to love one like thee,<br />
And you not despise a poor conquest like me?<br />
On lords, thy admirers, could look wi’ disdain,<br />
And knew I was naething, yet pitied my pain?<br />
You said while they teased you with nonsense and dress,<br />
‘When real the passion, the vanity’s less,’<br />
You saw through that silence which others despise,<br />
And while beaux we’re a-talking read love in my eyes.”</p>

<p class="p1">Through his successful wooing Dr. Webster was led to
devise the Ministers’ Widows Fund, so as to raise the social
<i>status</i> of his clerical brethren. In 1755 the first enumeration
of the people of Scotland was conducted under his
superintendence. He proposed the enlargement of the city of
Edinburgh by the erection of the new town. In the Highlands
and islands he promoted agricultural improvement. By
his wife he was energetically aided in works of active benevolence.
He died in 1784, having survived his helpmate eighteen
years.</p>

sadly defeated, his Majesty stood in a musefull melancholy,
and looked through his glass at a battery of cannon which was
still playing and was within reach of him. His troops had all
retired, only the Scots General Grant stood behind him at a
little distance; a cannon bullet took away the skirt of his coat,
and at last when he found that the King made no preparation
to retire, he came up to him and said, ‘Est-ceque votre majeste
veut prendre la batterie tout seul?’ The King looked at him
with approbation, and said, ‘Allons, mon ami,’ and retreated.
‘Eh bien, Grant,’ said he, ‘c’est une triste affaire.’”</p>

‘March furt in der Deivells naam,’ but did not think that the
King had been near him. He turned about, however, and there
was his Majesty’s horse’s mouth touching Burnet’s horse’s tail.
The King had lost a battle. The weather was bad. He was
muffled up in his great-coat, was in very bad humour, and
looked confoundedly sulky. Burnet was anxious to make way
for him, and immediately put spurs to his horse and sprung
away. The wood was so thick that the branches caught hold
of him and drove off his hat and wig. He had shaved his head
that morning, so that there he was, he sticking with his white
skull exposed to the elements. The King, notwithstanding his
ill-humour, could not help being diverted, and burst out into an
immense fit of laughter. He then said to Burnet, ‘Monsieur,
je vous demande pardon, mais je m’en vais le reparer.’ He then
called to a soldier, ‘Geve die Heer syn Hoed en zyn peruik.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Boswell said that young people are often tempted to resign
themselves to a warm fancy or a strong benevolent passion,
because they have read that those who are thus agitated are
nobler beings, and enjoy a felicity superior to that of sedate
rational men. But let them consider that all these fine things
have been said by the hot-brained people themselves, and that
one who is drunk may and does boast as much his intoxicated
situation. The impartial method of judging what state of mind
is happiest is to hear the voice of the majority of sensible men,
most of whom, either when young or when drunk, have felt the
enticing delirium. If none approve it but such as immediately
feel it, we may pronounce it a false joy. For other states, of
mind, as the cool circumspection of wisdom, the moderate
tenderness of affection, the solemn ardour of devotion, the noble
firmness of manly honour,&mdash;these others approve of; others wish
to possess.”</p>

the organist to give him liberty to play the vespers, which he
agreed to. Barnard played the solemn music very gravely, but

Auchinleck, and said he wished to see straggling trees. ‘I wish,’
said Boswell, ‘I could see straggling fools in this world.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Boswell said that business itself helps a man on just as the
chaise going down a hill helps on the horse which is in the
shafts. ‘When,’ said he, ‘I think of the fatigues of the law I
tremble. But when I have once get on the harnessing of a
Process, away I go without difficulty. This is just; let a man
never despond as to anything, let him be yok’d, and no fear.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“When Boswell observed that the Lords of Session were often
inattentive, he said he wished he had liberty to speak to the
bench as one speaks to a company, where if any one whom one
wishes to attend appears to be absent, one can rouse him by
directing the discourse particularly to him. ‘So,’ said Boswell,
‘I would say, “My Lord Sagely, your lordship must surely
agree,” &amp;c.; “But besides, my Lord Doubtfull, it appears,” &amp;c.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Boswell had a great aversion to the law, but forced himself
to enter upon that laborious profession in compliance with
the anxious desire of his father, for whom he had the greatest
regard. After putting on the gown, he said with great good

the service here; but I have observed that a prest man, either by
sea or land, after a little time does just as well as a volunteer.’”</p>

got him fairly in order I give one hearty push, and there he’s
landed.’”</p>

nothing more than to be of his acquaintance; we then wish to
have him as a companion; and when we have attained that we

conceive what satisfaction envious people could have by saying
that a work of genius such as the ‘Gentle Shepherd’ was not
written by its reputed author, but by some other person, as one
should imagine that they must be equally hurt by one person’s
being admired as by another. I accounted for it in this way:
that by ascribing it to another person than its reputed author,
they raise doubts whether the praise is due to the one or the
other, and so the admiration, instead of being fixed to one, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
kept <i>in equilibrio</i>, like Mahomet’s coffin between the two loadstones.”</p>

<p class="p2">“The celebrated Mr. Banks<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> before he set sail on his first
expedition was in love with a Miss Blosset; when he returned he
found himself so enthusiastically fond of roving in search of
unknown regions, that he could not think of matrimony. At the
same time he had shown such an attachment to the lady that it
was matter of great doubt in the world of private news whether he
would think himself bound in honour to marry her. General
Paoli asked Mr. Richard Owen Cambridge, ‘Pray, do you think
Mr. Banks will marry Miss Blosset?’ ‘Oh no, sir,’ said Mr.
Cambridge, ‘his thoughts are all <i>beyond</i> Cape <i>Horn</i>.’”</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">General Paoli.</span></p>

<p class="p2">“Dempster said that Cullen the mimick was to men’s characters
like wax to intaglios&mdash;to seals cut inwards: That men had
particularities, but that we did not perceive them till the impressions
of them were shown, reversed, bold, and prominent (or
words to that purpose), by Cullen’s mimickry.”</p>

<p class="pr2">I was present.</p>

<p class="p2">“In the spring, 1772, Dempster gave me the following lively
representation of Sir William Meredith.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> ‘He is no longer with
us,’ said he, ‘nor has he yet joined the ministry. He is like a
wart round which there is a string tied. All circulation is
stopped between him and us; and he is ready to be cut off
whenever the ministry please.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“I was one of Mr. Ross<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> the player’s counsel as a friend.
His spouse, the celebrated Fanny Murray, made me a present of
some very pretty straw mats for setting dishes on. Lord
Auchinleck observed to me, ‘Well, James, she cannot say that
then she does not value your advice a <i>straw</i>.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Mr. C. F. told a story in a company in a very confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
manner, and then said he told it in confidence, and then begged
they would not repeat it. ‘Pray,’ said Dempster, ‘do you think
any of us can repeat this story’?”</p>

<p class="p2">“A Jew having been brought before Lord Mansfield as Lord
Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, applied to be admitted to
bail. He was dressed in very rich lace clothes. The counsel
against him disputed for a considerable time, alleging that the
bail which he offered was not good. My lord was tired and in
a hurry, and looking at the Jew’s rich clothes, ‘Why, sir,’ said
he, ‘he will burn for the money.’”</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Councillor Vansittart</span>, who was present.</p>

<p class="p2">“At the exhibition of the Royal Academy at London in 1772
there was a picture of Lord Clive renouncing Meer Jaffier’s
legacy in favour of the East India Company, for the support of
invalids. Dempster did not perfectly believe the story of this
picture. He was dining at Sir George Colebrooke’s,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and Lady
Colebrooke would needs expatiate upon this picture, and on the
subject of it. ‘Madam,’ said Dempster, ‘I take it that affair
won’t bear to be <i>canvassed</i>.’”</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Dempster.</span></p>

<p class="p2">“On Monday, the 2nd November, 1772, I dined at Fortune’s
in company with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and several more,
at an entertainment given by Mr. Hamilton, of Bangour,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> when
the following good things passed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lord Kelly<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> said of a Mr. Wright who was present, ‘He
has been in several parts of the world, and I expect to see him
in Otaheite before he dies.’ ‘So then, my lord,’ said David Hume,
Esq., ‘you expect to be there yourself.’ My lord, in order to
retort upon Hume for this catching at his word, set himself in a
steady posture, and said, ‘My dear David, if you were to go
there you would be obliged to retract all your essays on miracles.’
‘Oh no, my lord,’ said Hume, ‘everything there is in nature.’
‘Aye,’ said the Earl, ‘(but) there are different natures.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Mr. Hamilton of Bangour’s lady, was that morning delivered
of a son, who was not yet baptized. Lord Kelly proposed his
health; but addressing himself to Principal Robertson, said,
‘Doctor, this is not a safe toast for you, for he’s not a Christian.’
‘My lord,’ said the Principal, ‘there are good hopes.’ Hume
laughed. Said the Earl, ‘David, if there are hopes, I am afraid
it will be worse for you.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Somebody observed that Lord Elibank<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> was constantly reading
Lucretius; another asked, ‘Has he given up Tacitus?’ Said
Lord Kelly, ‘It’s long since he gave up Tacitus; for he never can
hold his tongue a minute, and he has taken to Lucretius because
he feels himself grown so old that he would make but a poor
figure with Lucretia.’ At saying this the earl laughed, as if in
scorn, and cried, ‘Such nonsense!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">“Our frame and temper of mind depends much on the state
of our bodies. The human body is often called a machine, and
a wonderful machine it is. The blood is like quicksilver, the
veins like feathers, the nerves like springs. The soul sits in
the machine. As one who in a chaise when driving hard cannot
hear or give attention, I have been conscious of the corporeal
machine running on with such rapidity that I felt to apply seriously
to anything was in vain for me while that continued.”</p>

<p class="p2">“Mr. Crosbie,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> the advocate, when he once took up an idea
retained it most obstinately, even after there was convincing
evidence against it. On occasion of the great cause between
Nabob Fullerton<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and Orangefield,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> where he and I were on
opposite sides, he persisted in thinking Fullerton in the right,
when every one else was clear against him. I said Crosbie’s
head was like a Christmas-box with a slit in the top of it. If
once a thing has got into it, you cannot get it out again but by
breaking the box. ‘We must break your head, Crosbie,’
said I.”</p>

<p class="p2">“It’s a good thing for Scotland that we can appeal to the
House of Lords. I look upon that court, the House of Lords,
as a great rolling stone, which by going over a cause effectually
smooths it at once, when our fifteen lords, who have been
breaking the clods with their mallets for a long time, may have
left some parts rough; or sometimes may have found large
masses which they have not been able to break at all. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
rolling stone can never do harm. If the cause is smooth, it will
make it more firmly so; if rough in whole or in part, will
smooth it.”</p>

<p class="p2">“Banks and Solander were telling of a monstrous crater which
they had found in Iceland, which threw up prodigious quantities
of hot water to an amazing height. The story, I believe, was
true. But I had my joke on them as travellers; I said they had
found a kettle to boil Pontopidan the Bishop of Berghen’s wonderful
fish.”</p>

<p class="p2">“I have observed that the Lords of Justiciary in Scotland,
though they proceed with strong common sense and in general
with material justice, yet have not studied criminal law as a
science, though it is a very extensive, important, and nice one.
Being lords of session, their attention is chiefly taken up with
civil affairs, and they take criminal matters only by the bye.
They are like barber-surgeons, who shave&mdash;and bleed&mdash;upon
occasions.”</p>

<p class="p2">“There are a variety of little circumstances in life, which, like
pins in a lady’s dress, are necessary for keeping it together, and
giving it neatness and elegance.”</p>

<p class="p2">“A man of fame and acknowledged judgment as an author
giving his opinion to a bookseller in favour of a literary work,
the copy of which is offered for sale, when he does not sincerely
think as he says, is a piece of real dishonesty, quite different
from those commendations which a good-natured though not
strictly honest flattery bestows. It is like a goldsmith, to
whom suspicious metal is referred, certifying that it is gold
when he knows it to be brass or a bad mixture.”</p>

<p class="p2">“Dr. Johnson had a very high opinion of Edmund Burke.
He said, ‘That fellow calls forth all my powers;’ and once, when
he was out of spirits and rather dejected, he said, ‘Were I to see
Burke now ’twould kill me.’”</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Langton.</span><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">“Mr. Johnson used to laugh at a passage in Carte’s ‘Life<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> of
the Duke of Ormond,’ where he gravely observes ‘that he was
always in full dress when he went to court; too many being in
the practice of going thither with double lapells.’”</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Langton.</span></p>

<p class="p2">“&mdash;&mdash;, who translated ‘Ariosto,’ had a dispute with Tom
Wharton<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> as to some passages of it. &mdash;&mdash; knew the subject
perfectly, but could not express himself. Wharton knew it very
superficially, but wrote with ease and vivacity. Johnson said
‘the one had ball without powder, and the other powder without
ball.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Johnson had a sovereign contempt for Wilkes and his
party, whom he looked upon as a mere rabble. ‘Sir,’ said he,
‘had Wilkes’s mob prevailed against Government, this nation had
died of <i>phthiriasis</i>.’ Mr. Langton told me this. The expression,
<i>Morbus pediculosus</i>, as being better known, would strike more.
<i>Lousy disease</i> may be put in a parenthesis.”</p>

<p class="p2">“Mr. Ilay Campbell<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> spoke with admirable good sense and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
ingenuity, but had a very weak voice and a diminutive appearance
and manner. I said his pleading was like Giardini’s playing
on a child’s fiddle.”</p>

<p class="p2">“The extracts of a book given in the review often please us
much more than the book itself does. The extracts are embellished
and illustrated with criticism. It is like collops well-seasoned
and served up with a good sauce, which are better
eating than the sirloin or rump from whence they are cut.
(Or, thus one eats with greater relish slices or collops well
seasoned and served up with a good sauce, than one does the
sirloin or rump from whence they are cut).”</p>

<p class="p2">“I said the Court of Session was much more quiet and
agreeable when President Dundas<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> was absent. ‘When he is
there,’ said I, ‘you feel yourself as in a bleachfield with a large
dog in it. He is chained and does not bite you. But he barks
<i>wowf, wowf</i>, and makes you start; your nerves are hurt by him.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“Mr. Alexander Murray,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> said that the President Dundas
upon the bench was like Lord Kelly playing in a concert&mdash;very
quick, loud, and rumbling. Nothing can be a more lively
representation of his manner than this, when you harangue a
little with the president’s blustering tone and bounces of voice
at intervals&mdash;‘I cannot agree to give you this cause against the
Duke of Gordon, sitting here as judge on great revolution
principles,’ &amp;c.”</p>

<p class="p2">“I said that Mr. Charles Hay<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and I, who studied Scotch law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
together, used to go to Mr. McLaurin,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> when we found any
difficulty, as to a mill to get it ground. ‘Yes,’ said Crosbie,
‘and he made you twenty difficulties out of one.’ ‘The observation,’
said I, ‘is just and witty. It reminds me of the fable of
the lady, who when she was not pleased with her looks dashed
the mirror in pieces, and so saw a multitude of ugly faces instead
of one.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“26th June, 1774.&mdash;At a Sunday’s supper at Dr. Webster’s,
when I was finding fault with a lady for going to visit a relation
who had married a low man, the Doctor said that treating
such people with mere civility was the best way to get the
better of them. I answered, ‘I don’t want to get the better of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
them, I want to get rid of them: you may get the better of a sow
by going into the mire and boxing it; but who would do it?’
My wife, who wanted to support Dr. Webster, though she had
not much attended to the dispute, said something which was of
pretty much the same import with my remarks. ‘Well,’ said I,
‘this is good enough. She thinks she is opposing me, and yet
she agrees with me; she thinks she is riding a race with me
and getting the better, and all the time she is behind me.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“My father told me that when he got his gown upon the
resignation of the worthy Lord Dun,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> he went and waited
upon him, and said, ‘My lord, as I am to be your lordship’s
unworthy successor I am come to ask your blessing.’ ‘Sir,’
said Lord Dun, ‘I held that office too long, for I was come to
be but half a judge. Nay, what do I say? I was come to be
worse, for I was able to give corporal presence but one-half of
the year, and when I was present I could not have given that
attention which every man ought to have who decides on the
property of others. But to tell you the truth, I held my office
from an apprehension that they might put in a man even worse
than half a judge. However, sir, since you are to be my
successor,’&mdash;(he then paid my father some genteel compliments);
he added, ‘I have no title to give a blessing, but if my prayers
can be of any service to you, while I live they shall never be
wanting.’”</p>

<p class="p2">“29th June, 1774.&mdash;I said the business of the Court of
Session went on as fast without the President<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> as with him,
though with less noise, when he was absent the court was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="p2"><i>Page 52.</i>&mdash;In his “Life of Garrick” (Lond., 1868, vol. I.,
p. 422) Mr. Percy Fitzgerald presents the following narrative of
Boswell’s appearance at a dinner in Guildhall. The date 1759
assigned to the occasion is evidently erroneous. It is not improbable
that it took place shortly after the interchange of
letters between him and Mr. Pitt. “The Grocer in London”
was probably composed in the manner of the “Song of the
Barber,” quoted at page 36.</p>

<p>“At a Guildhall dinner, when Mr. Pitt was present with
Sir Joshua [Reynolds] and other celebrities, Mr. Boswell contrived
to be asked to sing; then, standing up, he delivered a
short speech referring to himself, in which he said that he had
had the good fortune to be introduced to most of the crowned
heads and distinguished characters in Europe, but with all his
exertions had never attained the happiness of being presented
to a gentleman, who was an honour to his country, and whose
talents he held in the highest esteem. All the company understood
the allusion, but Mr. Pitt remained perfectly cold and
impassive. Then Mr. Boswell gave his song, which was a sort
of parody on Dibdin’s ‘Sweet Little Cherub,’ and called ‘A
Grocer in London.’ The minister was a member of the Grocers’
guild, and this absurdity was in his honour. So far this was
ludicrous enough, but Boswell, half volunteering and half pressed
by the company, and no doubt much affected by the wine, sang
this song over no less than six times, until Mr. Pitt’s muscles at
length relaxed, and he was obliged to join in the general roar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Mr. Taylor, who was present, walked home with the author of
the song, and recollected that they roared ‘Grocer of London’
all through the streets.”</p>

<p><i>Pages 49</i> and <i>110</i>.&mdash;Boswell was wont to attend public executions,
both in Edinburgh and London, but the propensity of
witnessing such spectacles was in his mind unassociated with an
indifference to suffering. His love of excitement overcame his
natural sympathies, and obscured his judgment. In June, 1790,
he induced Sir Joshua Reynolds to accompany him to Newgate, to
witness the execution of five convicts. One of these, an old
servant of Mrs. Thrale, recognised Boswell among the crowd, and
bowed to him from the scaffold. Some persons having censured
Sir Joshua for being present at such a revolting spectacle,
he justified his procedure in a letter to Boswell. An extract
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am obliged to you for carrying me yesterday to see the
execution at Newgate of the five malefactors. I am convinced
it is a vulgar error; the opinion that it is so terrible a spectacle,
or that it in any way implies a hardness of heart or cruelty of
disposition, any more than such a disposition is implied in
seeking delight from the representation of a tragedy. Such an
execution as we saw, when there was no torture of the body, or
expression of agony of the mind, but when the criminals, on the
contrary, appeared perfectly composed, without the least trembling,
ready to speak and answer with civility and attention any
question that was proposed, neither in a state of torpidity nor
insensibility, but grave and composed,&mdash;I am convinced from
what we saw, and from the report of Mr. Ackerman, that it is a
state of suspense that is the most irksome and intolerable to the
human mind, and that certainty, though of the worst, is a
more eligible state; that the mind soon reconciles itself even to
the worst, when that worst is fixed as fate.... I consider it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
is natural to desire to see such sights, and, if I may venture, to
take delight in them, in order to stir and interest the mind, to
give it some emotion, as moderate exercise is necessary for the
body.”</p>

<p><i>Page 136.</i>&mdash;When he was passing through the press his “Tour
to the Hebrides,” Boswell conceived the idea of sitting for his
portrait to Sir Joshua Reynolds. The following letter which he
addressed to the great artist is peculiarly characteristic:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The debts which I contracted in my father’s
lifetime will not be cleared off by me for some years. I therefore
think it unconscientious to indulge myself in any expensive
article of elegant luxury. But in the meantime you may die,
or I may die; and I should regret very much that there should
not be at Auchinleck my portrait painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
with whom I have the felicity of living in social intimacy.
I have a proposal to make to you. I am for certain to be called
to the English Bar next February: will you now do my picture?
and the price shall be paid out of the first fees which I
receive as a barrister in Westminster Hall. Or if that fund
should fail, it shall be paid at any rate five years hence by myself
or my representatives. If you are pleased to approve of this
proposal, you signifying your concurrence underneath upon two
duplicates, one of which shall be kept by each of us, will be a
sufficient voucher of the obligation. I ever am, with very sincere
regards, my dear sir, your faithful and affectionate humble
servant,</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">James Boswell</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">“<i>London, 7th June, 1785.</i>”</p>

<p>This letter was endorsed by Sir Joshua thus:&mdash;“I agree to the
above condition.&mdash;London, September 10th, 1785.” Boswell’s
portrait, in <i>kit-cat</i> size, was painted by Sir Joshua some time
afterwards. Whether a price was named or paid does not
appear, but it is certain the biographer and the great painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
remained in terms of the closest friendship. Sir Joshua died in
1792; he bequeathed to Boswell the sum of £200, to be expended,
if he thought proper, in the purchase of a picture at
the sale of his paintings, to be kept for his sake. Boswell’s
portrait by Reynolds is now in the collection of Sir Robert
Peel, Bart. (“Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds,” by
C. R. Leslie, R.A., and Tom Taylor. Lond., 1815, 2 vols.)</p>

I happened however to be present on an occasion when a quotation
from Dr. Johnson served as a special illustration of the infallible
memory and rapid intuition of a man of letters in whose distinction
Scotland has a considerable share. It was in the house of a lady of
literary and social importance in her day, who was fond of displaying
her disregard of religious decencies. At one end of the table the
party were talking of a remarkable fall of some fronts of houses in
Tottenham-court-road, leaving the rooms open to the street in all
their usual conditions. At the other the hostess was tracing resemblances
between Mormonism and Christianity, with peculiar application
to their founders. Mr. Macaulay, seated in the middle, leant
over to Dean Milman opposite, and said in a low tone, “You remember
Johnson’s London,&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc8s">‘Here falling houses thunder on your head,<br />
And here a female Atheist talks you dead.’”</p>

This opinion receives an accidental confirmation of its events by
the publication of the Life of Sir Gilbert Eliot&mdash;a work highly
honourable to a Scottish house by the dignity of its records and the
talent of their reproduction. This cannot be better expressed than in
the words of Lady Minto, writing from Edinburgh, February 21,
1802:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“This country has arrived at the true pitch of comfort and happiness.
The people are full of information, are natural, unassuming,
and social, but with a great mixture of occupation. People meet
together to be pleased, cheerful, and easy; even the Scotch pride has
its uses by putting the poor often on an equal footing with the rich.
A Douglas or a Scott would consider himself on a par with persons
of the highest title and rank; their education is equally good,
their society the same, their spirit and love of their country possibly
much greater. Almost every family can boast of heroes in some
generation, which excites emulation; and nothing is so uncommon as
to see idle men and listless manners. All is energy, and every one
has some object in view to exercise his faculties and talents. I must
say, at the present time I think the race very superior to the English,
who are too far gone in luxury and dissipation to be agreeable or
happy. <i>Morals</i> here are certainly very good, and yet the manners are
much more free, and one scarcely ever meets with affectation and airs.
People meet like friends, and not with a cold bow and a distant
curtsey.”</p>

In reference to Thomas Boswell the following entries appear in
the Treasurer’s books:&mdash;May 15th, 1504. “Item, to Thomas Boswell
he laid downe in Leith to the wife of the kingis innis and to the
boye ran the kingis hors 18s.” Aug. 2, 1504. “Item, for twa
hidis to be jakkis to Thomas Boswell and Watte Trumbull, agane the
Raid of Eskdale [an expedition against the Border thieves], 56s.”
January 1, 1504-5. “Item, to Thomas Boswell and Pate Sinclair to
by thaim daunsing geir, 28s.” December 31, 1505. “Item, to 30
dosane of bellis for dansarris, delyverit to Thomas Boswell, £4 10s.”
In his “Collection of Criminal Trials,” Mr. Pitcairn, who quotes these
entries, supposes that Thomas Boswell held the position of royal
minstrel. In this office he was probably the successor of Sir William
Rogers, chief musician to James III. Rogers, like Boswell, obtained
from his sovereign a grant of lands in guerdon of service. He suffered
a violent death in 1482. (“Traquair Papers,” quoted in Chambers’
“History of Peeblesshire,” Edinb., 1861, 8vo., pp. 81-86.)</p>

Lord Balmuto was a large coarse-looking man, with black hair
and beetling eyebrows. Though not vulgar he was passionate, and
had a boisterous manner. My mother and her sisters gave him the
nickname of the “black bull of Norr’away,” in allusion to the northern
position of Balmuto.&mdash;“Personal Recollections of Mary Somerville,”

was by the interest of the Duke of Newcastle. For once at least his
Grace judged right.” The Duke of Newcastle was Prime Minister.</p>

This person is entitled to more than a passing notice. Long
before the modern publication of cheap literature by W. and R.
Chambers and Charles Knight, Alexander Donaldson opened a shop
in London for the sale of what were termed “spurious editions” of
popular books. The London booksellers endeavoured to check his
enterprise, but were defeated in the courts of law. Latterly he was
unfortunate. His nephew, James Donaldson, also a printer at Edinburgh,
founded and endowed the hospital in that city which bears
his name. For that purpose he bequeathed the sum of £200,000.</p>

From the Hebrides Dr. Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale in these
terms:&mdash;“We had a passage of about twelve miles to the point where
Sir Alexander Macdonald resided, having come from his seat, in the
middle of the island, to a small house on the shore, as we believe, that
he might with less reproach entertain us meanly. If he aspired to
meanness, his retrograde ambition was completely gratified; but he
did not succeed equally in escaping reproach. He had no cook, nor I
suppose much provision; nor had the lady the common decencies of
her tea-table; we picked up our sugar with our fingers. Boswell
was very angry, and reproached him with his improper parsimony....
I have done thinking of Sir Alexander Macdonald, whom we
now call Sir Sawney; he has disgusted all mankind by injudicious
parsimony, and given occasion to so many stories, that Boswell has
some thoughts of collecting them, and making a novel of his life.”

This satirical allusion to Lord Monboddo is conceived in the very
worst taste. His lordship had shown marked attention to Boswell in
his youth, and had entertained him and Dr. Johnson at Monboddo,
during the progress of their tour. Latterly his lordship and Dr.
Johnson had differed, and probably on this account Boswell considered
himself entitled to make this offensive allusion to his philosophical
opinions.</p>

John Johnston, of Grange, was one of Boswell’s early and
more confidential associates. Professionally a writer to the signet, he
owned the small estate of Grange, Dumfriesshire, which brought him
a rental of about £100 per annum. In a letter to the Hon. Andrew
Erskine, dated 8th May, 1762, Boswell alludes to Johnston in these
terms:&mdash;“I shall be at Dumfries soon, when I hope to see my friend
Johnston. We will talk much of old Scotch history, and the memory
of former years will warm our hearts. Johnston is a very worthy
fellow. I may safely say so, for I have lived in intimacy with him
more years than the Egyptian famine lasted.” In his reply Erskine
desires to be kindly remembered to “honest Johnston.” He inquires
whether “his trees are growing well at his paternal estate of Grange;
if he is as fond of Melvil’s Memoirs [“Memoirs of Sir James Melvil,
of Halhill,” London, 1752, 8vo.] as he used to be; and if he continues
to stretch himself in the sun upon the mountains near Edinburgh.”
Johnston fell into bad health. He predeceased Boswell, who became
a creditor on his estate. At Boswell’s death the trustees on Johnston’s
estate were indebted to his representatives in the sum of £195. (See
<i>supra</i>, p. 188.)</p>

The Hon. Henry Erskine, a celebrated humorist, was second son
of Henry David, tenth Earl of Buchan, and brother of Lord Chancellor
Erskine: he was born at Edinburgh, in November, 1746. He
passed advocate in 1768, and soon attained professional eminence.
He was appointed Lord Advocate on the accession of the Coalition
Ministry in 1783, and three years afterwards was chosen Dean of
Faculty. On the return of the liberal party to power he was reappointed
Lord Advocate, and was at the same time elected M.P.
for the Dumfries burghs. After a period of broken health, he died

On the 2nd June, 1790, Lord George Gordon, M.P., a younger
son of Cosmo George, third Duke of Gordon, led 100,000 persons in
procession to the House of Commons, to present a petition against a
measure for relieving Roman Catholics from certain disabilities and
penalties. The procession was followed by a riot, which continued
several days, and was attended with the destruction of Catholic
chapels and private dwellings. The prisons of London, too, were
thrown open by the rabble, and the mansion of the chief justice
thrown down. Lord George Gordon was tried for high treason, but
acquitted. Afterwards convicted of libelling Queen Marie Antoinette
of France, and presenting a petition reflecting on the laws and
administration of criminal justice, he was committed to Newgate,
where he died on the 1st November, 1793. Lord George Gordon
evidently laboured under mental aberration, and ought to have been
placed in a lunatic asylum.</p>

Alexander, tenth Earl of Eglinton, was a friend of the Auchinleck
family, and one of Boswell’s early patrons. Born in 1726, he
succeeded his father in his third year. A zealous promoter of agriculture,
he was much beloved by his tenantry and neighbours. He
was mortally wounded by a poacher, whom he sought forcibly to
deprive of his firelock: he died on the 25th October, 1769.</p>

Dr. Hugh Blair, the celebrated preacher and rhetorician, was a
central figure in the literary society of Edinburgh. He was collegiate
minister of the High Church, and professor of rhetoric in the
University. The first volume of his “Sermons” was published by
Strahan, on the recommendation of Dr. Johnson. Dr. Blair was an
early patron of Burns, and to his encouragement and active assistance
Macpherson was much indebted in producing his first specimens of
Ossianic poetry. Dr. Blair died at Edinburgh on the 27th December,
1800, aged eighty-two.</p>

James Macpherson, the editor of Ossian, established his residence
in London in 1766, in his twenty-eighth year. In 1780 he was elected
M.P. for Camelford. He died at Belleville, Inverness-shire, on the 17th
February, 1796, aged fifty-eight. Boswell’s allusion to John Bull is
explained by the attacks made on Macpherson by Dr. Johnson and other
English writers, in reference to the authenticity of Ossian’s poems.</p>

John Hall-Stevenson was a relative of Laurence Sterne, and the
“Eugenius” of his “Tristram Shandy.” His “Crazy Tales,” which
appeared anonymously in 1762, are described by Sir Walter Scott as
“witty and indecent.” Bishop Warburton describes Hall-Stevenson
as “a monster of impiety and lewdness.” He died in 1785. He
is noticed in Dr. Alexander Carlyle’s Autobiography.</p>

Dr. William Robertson, the historian, was son of a Scottish
clergyman, and claimed descent from the Robertsons of Struan, an
important family in the Highlands. Born in 1721, he was appointed
minister of Gladsmuir in 1743; he was translated to one of the city
churches of Edinburgh in 1758, and three years afterwards was
appointed Principal of the University. He became historiographer
royal for Scotland, and received other offices attended with honours
and emoluments. His “History of Scotland during the Reigns of Mary
and James VI.” appeared in 1759, and at once attracted attention.
His other historical works sustained his reputation. He died on the
11th June, 1793, aged seventy-one. His sister, Mrs. Syme, was
grandmother of Henry, Lord Brougham.</p>

Hugh Home, third Earl of Marchmont, was celebrated for his
elegant learning and remarkable powers of debate. He enjoyed the
esteem of Chatham and Walpole. Lord Cobham placed his bust in
the temple of worthies at Stowe; and Pope, who enjoyed his intimacy,
has thus celebrated him in the grotto at Twickenham,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfcen p1">“There the bright flame was shot through Marchmont’s soul.”</p>

<p class="pfc4 p1">Dr. Johnson entertained a prejudice against him, but was induced
by Boswell to wait on him for his recollections of Pope. Johnson
was received by the earl with much cordiality, and at the close of a
long interview he remarked to Boswell that he “would rather have
given twenty pounds than not have come.” Lord Marchmont died
on the 10th January, 1794, aged eighty-six.</p>

Samuel Foote, the celebrated comedian, was born in 1720, at
Truro, in Cornwall; he belonged to a respectable family, but he soon
wasted his inheritance and his wife’s fortune by a course of dissipation.
Compelled by necessity, he became a player, making his <i>début</i> in the
Haymarket Theatre in 1747. From a grotesque imitation of leading
persons he attained popularity, accompanied with a rancorous feeling on
the part of those whom he subjected to ridicule. He was an entertaining
companion, but possessed few amiable qualities. He died in
October, 1777, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

George Lyttleton was born in 1709. As a commoner he entered
Parliament in his twenty-first year. He opposed Walpole, and in 1732
was appointed secretary to Frederick, Prince of Wales. On Walpole’s
retirement he obtained a succession of offices, culminating in the
Chancellorship of the Exchequer; in 1759 he was raised to the peerage.
Henceforth he cultivated letters, producing various works in
prose and verse. He was inclined to indolence, but was much
esteemed for his high principle and moral worth. He died 22nd
August, 1773.</p>

Boswell has inserted this anecdote in his Life of Dr. Johnson. Sir
James Macdonald, Bart., the “Scottish Marcellus,” was eighth baronet
of Sleat, and male representative of the Lords of the Isles. Born
in 1741, he early distinguished himself at Eton by the variety of
his accomplishments, and high hopes were entertained of his career.
He was unhappily seized with a complication of disorders, of which
he died on the 26th July, 1766, at the age of twenty-five.</p>

Voltaire visited England in 1724, when Dr. Samuel Clarke was
in the zenith of his fame. His “Evidences of Natural and Revealed
Religion” appeared in 1705, and was followed by other theological
and philosophical works. Dr. Clarke was born at Norwich in
1675, and died in 1729. He displayed a playful humour among his
ordinary associates, but was grave and circumspect in the presence
of strangers, especially of forward or eccentric persons.</p>

With the Rev. William Brown, minister of the Scottish Church
at Utrecht, Boswell became acquainted during his residence in that
city. Mr. Brown had a personal history, not uneventful. Son of
the Rev. Laurence Brown, minister of Lintrathen in Forfarshire, he
rescued when a theological student several officers captured by the
rebels at the battle of Prestonpans. The rescue took place at
Glammis, the captors being followers of Lord Ogilvie, a zealous adherent
of the Prince. Soon afterwards Mr. Brown was ordained minister
of Cortachy, a parish inhabited by Lord Ogilvie’s tenantry. Reports
to his disadvantage soon spread, and in 1748 he demitted his
charge on account of “the odium of the disaffected, the prejudices
of the people, and his life being attacked by a ruffian.”
Through the influence of the Duke of Cumberland he was appointed
chaplain to a British regiment stationed in Flanders, and was subsequently
admitted pastor of the Scottish church at Utrecht. In 1757
he received a commission from the Crown as Professor of Church
History at St. Andrews, but he did not obtain induction for several
years; his appointment, on account of the rumours at Cortachy, being
resisted both by the university and the presbytery. He was at
length admitted by decree of the General Assembly. His lectures
were composed in Latin, but his theological attainments were less conspicuous
than his patriotism. He died on the 10th January, 1791,
aged seventy-two. His son was the celebrated William Laurence
Brown, Principal of Marischal College, Aberdeen.</p>

She married the duke’s valet, whose name was Macall. They were
both favourites of the duke and duchess, who resolved to establish
them comfortably. As they inclined to open an hotel in London,
the duke secured eligible premises. Macall was deemed a name
unsuited for a London landlord, and on the duke’s suggestion it was
changed to Almack.</p>

An amiable man, but crushing satirist, Caleb Whitefoord was
born at Edinburgh in 1734. He was intended for the Scottish
Church, but preferring the concerns of business, settled in London
as a wine merchant. He contributed satirical poems, in prose and
verse, to the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, directing his shafts chiefly against
Wilkes. He attracted the notice of Government, and on his recommendation
Dr. Johnson was requested to prepare his pamphlet in
defence of the recent negotiations respecting the Falkland Islands.
He was secretary of the commissioners appointed to meet at Paris in
1782, to treat of a general peace with America on the separation of
the colonies from the mother country. He latterly received a Civil
List pension, and was honoured with the diplomas of the Royal and
other societies. He is described by Goldsmith in his poem, “The
Retaliation.” He died in 1809, aged seventy-five.</p>

The Rev. John Home, author of “Douglas,” was born at
Ancrum, Roxburghshire, on the 22nd September, 1722. Having
studied for the Church, he was in 1741 ordained minister of Athelstaneford.
During the previous year he distinguished himself as
member of a volunteer corps in support of Government; he was
taken prisoner by the rebels at the battle of Falkirk, but contrived to
escape from Doune Castle, where he was confined. In 1755 he
produced his tragedy of “Douglas,” which soon became popular.
On account of encouraging theatricals, he was assailed by his clerical
brethren: he escaped deposition by resigning his charge. He obtained
a Civil List pension of £300, with the sinecure office of conservator of
Scots privileges at Campvere. He died 5th September, 1808, in
his eighty-sixth year.</p>

Mr., afterwards Sir Andrew Mitchell, was only son of the Rev.
William Mitchell, minister of the High Church, Edinburgh, and
who had the singular distinction of being five times Moderator of
the General Assembly. After following legal pursuits at Edinburgh,
Mr. Mitchell was in 1741 appointed secretary to the Marquis of
Tweeddale, minister for the affairs of Scotland, and in 1747 was
chosen M.P. for the Banff district of burghs. In 1751 he was sent
as ambassador to Brussels, and in 1753 was created a Knight of the
Bath and envoy extraordinary to the court of Prussia. He was a
great favourite with Frederick the Great, whom he accompanied in
his campaigns. He died at Berlin, on the 28th January, 1771.

Archibald, third Duke of Argyll, was born in June, 1682. As
colonel of the 36th regiment he served under the Duke of Marlborough.
Devoting himself to civil affairs, he was in 1705 nominated
Lord High Treasurer of Scotland; in the following year he became a
commissioner on the Union, and in 1710 was appointed Justice
General. He was wounded at the battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715, when
he held a command under his brother, the Duke of Argyll and
Greenwich. He succeeded his brother as Duke of Argyll in 1743,
and died 15th April, 1761. He founded the family residence at
Inverary, and there established a valuable library. He was a zealous
promoter of learning, and excelled in conversation.</p>

The celebrated George, tenth Earl Marischal, whom Boswell had
the honour of accompanying through Germany and Switzerland in
1763. Born about 1693, Lord Marischal held a high command in
the army of Queen Anne, and on her death signed the proclamation
of George I. Deprived of office by the Duke of Argyll, he joined the
Earl of Mar in the insurrection of 1715, and at the battle of Sheriffmuir
commanded two squadrons of cavalry. In 1719 he made a
second attempt on behalf of the Chevalier. In the rising of 1715 he
took no part. Having by a residence in Prussia gained the favour of
Frederick the Great, he became Prussian ambassador at the courts of
France and Spain. In 1759 he revealed to Mr. Pitt, afterwards Earl
of Chatham, the family compact of the house of Bourbon; he was,
consequently, invited to the court of George II., and his attainder
was reversed. On possessing himself of his forfeited estates he purposed
to reside in Scotland, but on the urgent entreaty of the Prussian

Of John, fourth Earl of Loudoun, Boswell in his “Scottish Tour”
thus writes:&mdash;“He did more service to the county of Ayr in general,
as well as to individuals in it, than any man we have ever had....
The tenderness of his heart was proved in 1745-6, when he had an
important command in the Highlands, and behaved with a generous
humanity to the unfortunate. I cannot figure a more honest politician;
for though his interest in our country was great and generally
successful, he not only did not deceive by fallacious promises, but was
anxious that people should not deceive themselves by too sanguine
expectations. His kind and dutiful attention to his mother was unremittent.
At his house was true hospitality, a plain but a plentiful
table; and every guest being left at perfect freedom, felt himself quite
easy and happy. While I live I shall honour the memory of this
amiable man.” Boswell relates that, having sent a message that he
and Dr. Johnson purposed to dine with him, the messenger reported
that the earl “jumped for joy.” John, fourth earl of Loudoun, was
born in 1705, and died in 1782.</p>

I am told the King of Prussia will say to a servant, ‘Bring me a bottle
of such a wine, which came in such a year; it lies in such a corner of
the cellar.’ I would have a man great in great things, and elegant in

A native of Ayrshire, Matthew Henderson long resided in Edinburgh,
where his society was much cherished. Allan Cunningham
relates on the authority of Sir Thomas Wallace, who knew him personally,
“that he dined regularly at Fortune’s Tavern, and was a
member of the Capillaire Club, which was composed of all who
inclined to be witty and joyous.” When Robert Burns visited
Edinburgh in 1787, Matthew Henderson was one of his chief associates;
he subscribed for four copies of the second edition of his
poems, and by his pleasing and beneficent manner gained a deep place
in his affections. Henderson died in the summer of 1790, and his
memory was celebrated by the Ayrshire bard in an elegiac poem, of
which the following stanzas are familiar:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc8q p1">“O Henderson! the man&mdash;the brother!<br />
And art thou gone, and gone for ever?<br />
And hast thou crossed that unknown river,</p>
<p class="pfc10">Life’s dreary bound?</p>
<p class="pfc8">Like thee where shall I find another</p>
<p class="pfc10">The world around?</p>
<p class="pfc8q p1">“Go to your sculptured tombs, ye great,<br />
In a’ the tinsel trash o’ state!<br />
But by thy honest turf I’ll wait,</p>
<p class="pfc10">Thou man o’ worth!</p>
<p class="pfc8">And weep the ae best fellow’s fate</p>
<p class="pfc10">E’er lay in earth.”</p>
<p class="pfc4 p1">In transmitting the poem to Mr. McMurdo, Burns writes from
Ellisland, 2nd August, 1790, “You knew Henderson? I have not
flattered his memory.” In a tract by the Lord Chief Commissioner
Adam, entitled “Two Short Essays on the Study of History&mdash;the gift
of a grandfather,” and printed at the Blair-Adam press in 1836, the
author concludes a list of eminent Scotsmen, his contemporaries,
with the following note:&mdash;“Besides these here enumerated, there were
many others who made a respectable figure in the society of Edinburgh
during the period here referred to (between 1750 and 1766), and there
were some who stand more prominently forward, whose rank, whose
wit, and whose taste and talent for conversation adorned the society
when they joined it, such as Thomas, Earl of Kelly; Thomas, Earl of
Haddington; Nisbet, of Dirleton; <i>Matthew Henderson, at a future
period distinguished by Burns</i>; Sir Robert Murray, of Hillhead;
George Brown, of Elliestoun, and others.”</p>

Stair, was born about 1648, and passed advocate in 1672. With his
father he experienced much persecution under the rule of the House
of Stewart; he afterwards made his peace at court, and in 1687 was

An ancient Scottish ballad, entitled “The Bonnie Earl of Murray,”
is founded on the murder of James Stewart, Earl of Murray, son-in-law
and successor of the celebrated regent. He was slain at his own
residence at Donibristle, Fifeshire, on the 9th February, 1592, by
the hereditary enemy of his house, George, sixth Earl of Huntly.
According to the story, the Earl of Murray, who was young and
extremely handsome, attracted the admiration of Queen Anne of
Denmark, who in the king’s hearing described him as “a proper and
gallant man.” This emphatic commendation offended the king, who
requested the Earl of Huntly to bring him into his presence.
Huntly forthwith set fire to Donibristle Castle, and the earl in attempting
to escape was slain. Lord Huntly was thrown into prison,
but being released at the king’s command was created a marquess.
According to Boswell, James, seventh Earl of Moray, who died in
1767 was also styled “The Bonnie Earl.”</p>

entered the army in 1737, and served at Dettingen, Fontenoy, and
Culloden. In 1759 he was present at the battle of Minden, serving

Charles Hay passed advocate in 1768, and with the title of Lord
Newton was raised to the bench in 1806. By Lord Cockburn in
his “Memorials” he is thus described:&mdash;“A man famous for law,
paunch, whist, claret, and worth. His judicial title was Newton, but
in private life he was chiefly known as ‘the Mighty.’ He was a
bulky man with short legs, twitching eyes, and a large purple visage;
no speaker, but an excellent writer and adviser; deep and accurate in
his law, in which he had extensive employment. Honest, warm-hearted
and considerate, he was always true to his principles and his friends.
But these and other good qualities were all apt to be lost sight of in
people’s admiration of his drinking. His daily and flowing cups
raised him far above the evil days of sobriety on which he had fallen,
and made him worthy of honours quaffed with the Scandinavian
heroes. His delight was to sit smiling, quiet, and listening; saying
little, but that little always sensible, for he used to hold that conversation&mdash;at
least, when it was of the sort that merits admiration&mdash;spoiled
good company.” Lord Newton died on the 19th October,
1811.</p>

Pope has thus described the character of this noted libertine:&mdash;“Francis
Chartres, a man infamous for all manner of vices. When
he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment
for a cheat; he was next banished to Brussels, and drummed out of
Ghent on the same account. After a hundred tricks at the gaming-tables,
he took to lending money at exorbitant interest and on great
penalties, accumulating premium, interest, and capital into a new
capital, and seizing to a minute when the payments became due. In
a word, by a constant attention to the vices, wants, and follies of mankind,
he acquired an immense fortune. He was twice condemned for
rapes and pardoned, but the last time not without imprisonment in
Newgate, and large confiscations. He died in Scotland in 1731
(February, 1732). The populace at his funeral raised a great riot,
almost tore the body out of the coffin, and cast dead dogs into the
grave along with it.” Arbuthnot’s epitaph on Colonel Chartres is
celebrated for its epigrammatic force.</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
